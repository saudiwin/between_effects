It argues that internet freedom helps to advance civil society in the long run, while helping to prevent abuses of power in the short term.

An official statement by U.S. Secretary of State Hilary Clinton, regarding the U.S. policy on internet access and freedom, is discussed in this context.},

  Abstract                 = {The article presents definitions of rational choice that are modeled closely upon the actual decision processes pertaining to the behavior of organisms. Traditional economic theory postulates an "economic man," who, in the course of being "economic" is also "rational." This man is assumed to have knowledge of the relevant aspects of his environment which, if not absolutely complete, is at least impressively clear and voluminous. Recent developments in economics, and particularly in the theory of the business firm, have raised great doubts as to whether this schematized model of economic man provides a suitable foundation on which to erect a theory -- whether it be a theory of how firms do behave, or of how they "should" rationally behave. Broadly stated, the task is to replace the global rationality of economic man with a kind of rational behavior that is compatible with the access to information and the computational capacities that are actually possessed by organisms, including man},
  Annotation               = {\newline Simon lays out his original critique of rationalist assumptions, although he does so in a way that is meant to encourage rational choice explanation, not replace it. He has two primary objections: 1) the cognitive capacities of organisms may not measure up to what the model requires, and 2) the organism will have to gather information to construct a preference ranking and outcome mapping, which has a cost of its own. \newline His solution is to use heuristics, rules of thumb that allow actors to update their assessments of probabilities and preferences as they go along. Hence, a chess master will divide moves into winning or non-winning moves, and he will add to either set as he goes through the game in order to avoid the overwhelming cognitive demands of considering "all alternatives". It is clear how these ideas were later developed into more broad psychological theories. \newline In terms of economics, he thinks that firms likely hit generally accepted or unacceptable levels (a 0, 1 or -1) coding instead of a truly continuous function which would admit of maximization. People never think of, nor do they reach, maximums, but rather judge themselves relative to whatever their "aspiration level" is.},

  Annotation               = {\newline A\&R put forward an early IV model that uses settler mortality as an instrument for the effect of institutions on later economic wealth. They argue that settler mortality determined where ``quality" institutions were more likely to be created; this difference had an exogenous effect on the level of wealth of later countries. However, they never acknowledge that this is a LATE (CATE) effect that is limited to the covariation in institutional differences in 1700 and the DV which is measured in 1995. Thus in reality this effect is only for those countries which were ``treated" with differing settler mortality in 1700 and adopted correspondingly different institutions. Obviously the rate of compliance of the treatment should be close to 100\%... unless of course people simply opted out of ever colonizing a region if settler mortality was too high (i.e. there were defiers). They don't go into detail about these ``exclusion restrictions" other than asserting that settler mortality could not have an effect on economic wealth apart from institutions, which they back up with a ``over-identification test" using other measures of mortality and earlier institutions. (Note that M\&W do not like over-ID tests because they are difficult to interpret in a causal framework. \newline \newline class discussion. Pro versus anti property right institutions is the treatment. Disease patterns determine which path you are on. Disease patterns are independent of economic growth. Note that exclusion restriction argues that settler mortality only affects growth through property rights. However, mortality may also affect state development and technological diffusion, which could have an effect on later growth. Mortality may hurt productivity improvements. Or, Sachs argues that it is disease itself which is the causal link to growth, not property rights. Disease can affect growth in other ways. Note that A\&R have to argue to avoid this critique that the diseases don't affect locals as much as they affect foreigners. \newline \newline Are they only saying that places that could have European settlers are now wealthy? I.e., that it only matters how ``European" we are? This paper could have benefited from an identification of CACE. You can think of this paper of the average impact of institutions of extraction v. inclusion on colonies of whom the colonial government could have changed policy. This seems to only apply to the British government. The other colonial powers never really changed their policies regarding extraction.},

  Annotation               = {\newline Acemoglu et al put forward their own argument about income and democratization. They think that income does matter to democratization but that the channel is through the institutional makeup of countries. For that reason they re-estimate Przeworski and other models using country fixed effects. When they do so, the variation from income on the DV is no longer explained (they use Polity and Przeworksi as DVs). They think that the ``critical juncture" of colonization (re: their earlier work) explains these different institutional trajectories, although they are not clear why these trajectories would necessarily result in democratization. It appears that they are explaining differences in income more than differences in democratization. They also note that they are controlling for time covariation, which they assert soaks up a lot of variation and should be further explained. Note as well that Boix critiques them for using historical time windows that are too long and inflate standard errors (25-year lags). \newline},

  Annotation               = {\newline The authors develop a classification that is far more theoretically informed than previous attempts at democratization. They use a sufficient cause list (meeting of any one requirement excludes a country from being democratic). These are: chief executive elected, legislature elected, multiple parties \& competition, alternation in power. If a regime fails any of these conditions, they become democratic (or any one condition is sufficient for dictatorship). \newline \newline They fully acknowledge there are cases, particularly with alternation in power, that are difficult to code. They decide to err on the side of minimizing Type II error: they want to lower the number of cases that are incorrectly coded as democracies as opposed to the number that are incorrectly coded as dictatorships. In that sense, they are conservative as to what they consider a democracy, which to some extent limits the problems of a minimalist definition (a la Munck and Verkuilen). \newline \newline They specifically do not include social or economic indicators, human rights or "responsiveness", which they consider to be properties which may exist independently of democracy. Also, they do not look at participation as they argue it is not relevant post-WWII. They cite correlations a la Inkeles as proof that their index has at least some validity because it correlates with other indices of democracy (even though it is these indices which they start off by critiquing). This does Munck and Verkuilen's critique that correlation may only mean that these indices share underlying biases. \newline \newline Finally, they argue that continuous definitions of democracy is not relevant to the underlying concept, which either is or is not. They do note that there are cases they can't code because of a lack of transitions in power, but they consider these cases to be essentially measurement errors, not a problem in the definition per se. \newline},

  Abstract                 = {The wave of sit-ins that swept through the American South in the spring of 1960 transformed the struggle for racial equality. This episode is widely cited in the literature on social movements, but the debate over its explanation remains unresolved—partly because previous research has relied on case studies of a few large cities. The authors use event-history analysis to trace the diffusion of sit-ins throughout the South and to compare cities where sit-ins occurred with the majority of cities where they did not. They assess the relative importance of three channels of diffusion: movement organizations, social networks, and news media. The authors find that movement organizations played an important role in orchestrating protest; what mattered was a cadre of activists rather than mass membership. There is little evidence that social networks acted as a channel for diffusion among cities. By contrast, news media were crucial for conveying information about protests elsewhere. In addition, the authors demonstrate that sit-ins were most likely to occur where there were many college students, where adults in the black community had greater resources and autonomy, and where political opportunities were more favorable.},

  Annotation               = {\textbf{Hypothesis} \newline Rising levels of income inequality cause transitions to democracy through empowering a rising middle class, but falling levels of land inequality cause transitions to democracy through empowering small property owners. \newline \textbf{Measurement} \newline They use multiple measures of income to compute Gini coefficients. Bourguignon and Morrisson (2002a) is the only dataset with income inequality prior to WWII, covering 55 countries, and they also use Babones and Álvarez-Rivadulla (2007) post-WWII dataset of income inequality as an alternate measure covering 126 countries. Farms are measured using the same dataset in Boix (2003). They use both Boix and Rosato (2001)'s dichotomous democratization measure and Polity IV estimates for the dependent variable of regime transition. \newline They are unable to estimate directly the relative share of inequality of land versus industry. However, they argue that this is inferred from the model because rising income inequality holding land (i.e. farms) inequality constant will approximate the effect of intersectoral inequality. \newline Controls include GDP (from Madison (2006)) and literacy and educational attainment (Vanhanen, 2003). All missing values are filled in using linear interpolation. \newline \textbf{Research Design} \newline Ansell and Samuels construct a decision-theoretic model of intersectoral inequality with three classes of actors: elites, bourgeoisie and citizens. The model demonstrates how the likelihood of bourgeois and mass support of democratization changes along with rising or falling levels of land, income and intersectoral inequality. \newline Once they have drawn comparative statics, Ansell and Samuels test their model using quantitative data described above. They use a time-series probit model that predicts probabilities of transition similar to that used by Przeworksi et al. (2000) and Boix (2003). They also use a linear model in which the dependent variable is Polity IV. In order to address bias in the Polity IV scale, they also include an alternate specification with a binary control for each value of the Polity scale. They test Acemoglu and Robinson's inverted-U claim by including squared terms for Gini coefficients. \newline Because they are concerned about reverse causality (regime type causing inequality), they instrument for it using regional inequality as a proxy for the independent variable. \newline \textbf{Findings} \newline Across the different model specifications, rising land inequality is associated with continued authoritarianism while rising income inequality is associated with transitions to full or partial democracy. The effect of rising income inequality is greater for transitions to partial democracy (i.e., in the middle range of values of the Polity IV scale), which accords with their argument that the bourgeoisie will prefer partial over full democracy. They find no support for Acemoglu and Robinson's claim about an inverted-U relationship with inequality, although their model confirms the earlier work of Boix regarding the effect of land inequality on democratization. \newline They also argue that their work shows why the underlying logic of Acemoglu and Robinson and Boix is flawed because it is based on the median voter theorem application in Meltzer and Richards (1981). Because Meltzer and Richards' designed their model to apply to already-existing democracies, Ansell and Samuels argue, it should not be used to explain transitions from one regime type to another. \newline \textbf{Critical Evaluation} \newline Ansell and Samuels identify a critical flaw in Boix and Acemoglu and Robinson's models of democratization in which the elite is assumed to be unified. By modeling different sectors of the economy, they are able to show how a rising class of commercial elites (the upper middle class) can effect democratization under conditions of high inequality. While this claim is an elaboration of prior institutional theories such as North, it builds a theoretical foundation for more nuanced approaches to democratization. In particular, it provides quantitative support for class-coalitional arguments from Collier (1999) and Moore (1966) in which intra-elite bargaining and cohesion is a critical factor in a transition to or from democracy. The elites do not just bargain with the masses, but also with themselves. \newline The weakness of their approach is the reliability of the underlying data. Ansell and Samuels admit that their inequality data prior to World War II has some questionable characteristics, and their use of post-WWII data reveals different effects for the parameters of interest. This may imply their work suffers from a restricted time sample and also from a lack of properly measured independent variables. A much stronger test of their argument would use a separate measure for industrial income inequality versus land inequality instead of inferring the difference from overall income inequality. Also, medium or small-N studies could elucidate these causal processes in more detail, especially considering the paucity of available quantitative data. \newline \newline Class Discussion: Story about the rising bourgoise (originally from Marx). Some sectors of the rich fighting against other sectors of the rich. Distinct from A\&R and Boix and also harder to disprove. It is based on protection of property rights, not redistribution. \newline},

Introduction The newly independent countries of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe were among the most enthusiastic adopters of free market reforms. In the 1990s, not only did they adopt most of the policies of the οΏ½Washington consensusοΏ½ advocated by international financial institutions, such as trade and price deregulation, enterprise privatization, currency convertibility, and monetary stabilization (Williamson 1991), but they went beyond the Washington consensus to adopt second generation reforms like the flat tax and pension privatization (OοΏ½Dwyer and Kovalcik 2007). These second stage reforms replaced progressive tax systems with a single personal income tax rate and social security pension systems with pensions based on individual savings accounts. While not widely accepted or practiced in the advanced industrialized countries, these bold, if not radical, liberal reforms spread throughout Eastern European countries during a short period of time from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s (Figure 1). Pension privatization and the flat tax, like other second-stage institutional reforms (Naim 1994; Birdsall and Graham 1998; Krueger 2002), were enacted in an effort to attract foreign investment. Both benefited the rich more than the poor and both signaled a government οΏ½ οΏ½ οΏ½ Electronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1903132},

  Abstract                 = {Scholars blame high levels of ethnic heterogeneity for many social and political ills, including poor economic growth, corruption, and policy gridlock. But it can be argued that, in seeking reelection, politicians will join multiethnic coalitions to pass policies in this endeavor. Further, government expenditure increases with coalition size, as each politician seeks policies that benefit his or her own constituents. Subnational data from Zambia, the use of which helps control for country-level factors hindering standard cross-national studies of fiscal politics, indicate that government spending increases with ethnic heterogeneity. This evidence challenges studies which ignore the incentives generated by political institutions and claim that ethnicity leads directly to undesirable outcomes.},

It is not clear, though, if the presence or absence of landlords affected economic development in any way other than via this effect on public goods provision, so they also instrument landlords by a binary variable for the period of British colonization. Thus there is a 2-stage estimation going on, with intermediate stages tested later in the argument (particularly landlords and public good provision). So the causal argument is that districts which were treated by British colonial officials to landlords versus districts that were treated by British colonial officials to non-landlords. This would be a treatment effect for the whole population of districts in India assuming that all districts were colonized and all of them are in the sample. \newline \newline Note that they don't just use IV, they also use a matching technique in terms of adjacent landlord-non landlord districts. How could British ideas be endogenous to landlord systems? There is a measurement problem in terms of district size. Boundaries can often change and you can't assume that all units stay the same over time. \newline},

  Abstract                 = {This chapter provides a conceptual framework for integrating the array of variables defined in diffusion research to explicate their influence on an actor's decision to adopt an innovation. The framework groups the variables into three major components. The first component includes characteristics of the innovation itself, within which two sets of variables are defined concerning public versus private consequences and benefits versus costs of adoption. A second component involves the characteristics of innovators (actors) that influence the probability of adoption of an innovation. Within this component six sets of variables concern societal entity of innovators (either people, organizations, states, etc.), familiarity with the innovation, status characteristics, socioeconomic characteristics, position in social networks, and personal qualities. The third component involves characteristics of the environmental context that modulate diffusion via structural characteristics of the moder},

  Annotation               = {\newline From the introduction: Bates et al. want to combine both the testing of the implications of a theory and the iterated process of revising a theory through case studies. While they do evaluate alternative models, they primarily focus on one model which they seek to ``fit" to the data (17). Thus they do not explicitly endorse the idea of falsifying hypotheses but rather of testing a theory and rebuilding it. They are more interested in synthesis than in accepting or rejecting a theoretical tradition (17-18). \newline
\newline In the conclusion, Bates et al. suggest that the method of comparative statics allows them to test their theories on multiple cases, but only when there is a single prediction. They do not have any way of deriving comparative statics when there are multiple equilibria. Thus they suggest that theories often pertain to one structural time frame; there is not necessarily a clear way to let an exogenous variable become endogenous to the model. But, see Gingirech and Medina on a game theoretic model of multiple equilibria. \newline},

  Abstract                 = {Most nations have experienced an internal armed conflict since 1960. Yet while civil war is central to many nations' development, it has stood at the periphery of economics research and teaching. The past decade has witnessed a long overdue explosion of research into war's causes and consequences. We summarize progress, identify weaknesses, and chart a path forward. Why war? Existing theory is provocative but incomplete, omitting advances in behavioral economics and making little progress in key areas, like why armed groups form and cohere, or how more than two armed sides compete. Empirical work finds that low per capita incomes and slow economic growth are both robustly linked to civil war. Yet there is little consensus on the most effective policies to avert conflicts or promote postwar recovery. Cross-country analysis of war will benefit from more attention to causal identification and stronger links to theory. We argue that micro-level analysis and case studies are also crucial to decipher war's causes, conduct, and consequences. We bring a growth theoretic approach to the study of conflict consequences to highlight areas for research, most of all the study of war's impact on institutions. We conclude with a plea for new and better data.},

  Annotation               = {\newline This is the first reply to P \& L's study of modernization theory and facts. Their main critique is that at higher levels of income there are fewer authoritarian countries with which to estimate probabilities. They also argue the time scope is restricted, starting only at 1950. Also there is strong ommitted variable bias by excluding soviet countries and countries in the middle east. They use a dynamic probit model. They are do model simulations which help make sense of the coefficients. The out of sample prediction is the best critique of P \& L; it seems that the endogenous theory is primarily about democratization in Europe prior to 1925. \newline \newline Note that instead of controlling for oil and Soviet countries, they just remove the countries from their sample and rerun the model. A rather odd thing to do. If you re-run the simulation with a different sample, the coefficients used to calculate the sample won't change and you'll get an out-of-sample prediction. \newline},

  Annotation               = {\newline Boix puts forward a complementary argument to his assertion that both income and inequality matter for democratic transitions. In particular, he proposes that the international order mitigates and shapes the way that domestic variables influence transitions. He thinks that income matters mostly at low levels of income due to the declining marginal effect of income, while inequality matters at all income leves. However, income as a variable is most significant on democratic transition \& consolidation when the international order is receptive to democracy: i.e., when hegemons either don't have to worry about challengers with different institituions or a multi-polar world with institutional diversity across alliances. He finds that income is significant as an influence on democratization when the international order is most receptive, such as between WWI and WWII. \newline \newline He puts forward a well-developed database of his own Boix-Rosato codings and also the Polity database as a DV. He uses a variety of models with various attempts to instrument for income (such as genetic differences of populations in 1800). He also uses Granger causality tests and the full range of time series models to put forward his conclusions. Overall a strong argument, although the use of interactive variables is primarily restricted to categories even when he has continuous variables (i.e., log GDP). It seems to be a better strategy to use interactive graphs to find the effect. \newline},

  Annotation               = {\newline Brennan argues that Sen misunderstands the nature of rationality. He proposes that there are two fundamental definitions of rationality, one that is minimal and emphasizes explanation (a very mathematical formulation), and one that is expansive and focuses on normative concerns. The later normative concerns are what Brennan contends that Sen argues with. In contrast, Brennan believes that rationality can well include the concept of commitment because we can conceive of commitment as another value with which the agent is trading off. This seems to be the typical counter to objections of rationality. argue for the its explanatory and predictive potential, and argue that other conceptions of human identity can be subsumed under that rubric. \newline},

  Annotation               = {\textbf{Hypothesis} \newline High levels of U.S. military and economic aid have caused Egypt to remain an authoritarian country by constructing a ruling coalition, preventing coups, providing popular subsidies and strengthening repressive capacity. \newline \textbf{Measurement} \newline The concepts are measured primarily through data compiled from U.S. government reports. Brownlee in particular relies on classified U.S. cables found in the web site Wikileaks. U.S. Congressional records are used to track the levels of aid flowing to Egypt. \newline \textbf{Research Design} \newline There is no formal research design for this book, likely becuase it is written for a policy-oriented audience. Brownlee says his own research has focused on archival records, Wikileaks State Department cables, and interviews with U.S. policymakers and Egyptian journalists. This evidence is used to trace the causal process of U.S. aid in increasing the durability of Egypt's authoritarian regime, but there is no formal delineation of these causal processes. The book is written in a narrative format which moves from 1950s through to the Arab Spring, focusing on U.S. policymakers and Egyptian leaders. \newline \textbf{Findings} \newline Brownlee shows how the U.S. has consistently valued Egypt's regime type as a strategic asset in achieving foreign policy goals, from fighting the Soviet Union during the Cold War to the war on terror after 9/11. He argues that George W. Bush's democracy promotion agenda was conditioned on the administration's desire for a Middle East that reflected U.S. policy goals, and for that reason the U.S. stance on Egyptian democracy was rarely enforced with any level of consistency. By detailing the amounts of aid and the inner calculations of U.S. policymakers, Brownlee offers a portrait of how and why successive U.S. administrations have chosen to fund the Egyptian regime while knowing full well they were increasing the durability of an authoritarian state.\newline His case study contradicts an assertion made by Levistky and WAy (2010) that leverage and linkage to the U.S. should constrain autocrats from repressing the opposition. Instead, he argues that leverage and linkage are precisely what enabled the Egyptian regime to repress. \newline \textbf{Critical Evaluation} \newline Brownlee's book provides an illuminating narrative of one case detailing U.S. foreign policy interference in an attempted democratization. In that sense, it echoes Jamal's (2012) argument about how U.S. policy structures public opinion in Jordan and Kuwait. Taken together, these three studies provide considerable evidence for the proposition that U.S. influence changes domestic priorities for elites and can have a decisive effect on regime trajectories. \newline The weakness in the study is that it has only a limited cross-case comparability. Brownlee does critical differences between Tunisia and Egypt that enabled the former country to move towards democracy (i.e., the lack of a politicized military in Tunisia). However, these limited comparisons make it difficult to answer a question regarding endogeneity: is Egypt's strategic priority to the United States a historical accident (via the Arab-Israeli conflict), or is this strategic priority itself endogenous to the authoritarian regime? I.e., if Egypt had initially taken a democratic course after independence, would the U.S. have ever wanted to support the regime as an ally? The U.S. has been willing to drop allies when public opinion gets in the way, as happened most famously in Iran. Thus while Brownlee does show the influence of foreign policy on Egypt, he needs to provide more in the way of counterfactual analysis to describe what could have happened and why other plausible scenarios did not occur in this situation. Otherwise the work suffers from some selection bias in not considering the full range of possibilities of Egypt's trajectory since 1950.},

  Review                   = {they think that diffusion in the post-communist states was closely connected to regime form and "common enemy" (the USSR) (285) what they are wondering about is why after the initial wave they are still seeing electoral transitions in the post-communist states (285) diffusion implies emulation: "diffusion implies that outsiders make a conscious decision to copy what happens in another state" (286) they argue that there are two channels of diffusion: a fast one in which people find "attractive precedents" in the other country, and a slow one in which they import the techniques and strategies that the other group used (287) in either case, the conditions of the original revolution may be much different than the later revolutions, which leads to an eventual end of revolution diffusion (288) what is critical is that conditions in both regimes are "perceived" as held in common, regardless of whether or not they are (289) they also think that networks are very important for international diffusion (289) the model of diffusion in postcommunist states was that of sudden elections that were meant to overwhelm an unprepared and oppressed opposition, but in which the opposition won anyway (290-1) it is interesting that they include the group Otpor in their analysis, which was also influential in Egypt they think, re: Tarrow, that the "electoral model" was successful because it was modular: i.e., it was "an unusually well-defined set of activities" (294) the countries were also more ready for democracy -- i.e., traditions of protest and public participation, high education (295) they argue that "similar contexts" determined the spread of diffusion (although this argument depends on an enumeration of differences and similarities), but they also note, intriguingly, that there was "the belief as well that the spread of democracy through the region will help guarantee their democratic experiment" (297) techniques were share across borders because "democracy is not safe until it is embedded in a larger democratic community" (299)},

  Abstract                 = {This article lays the theoretical and methodological foundations of a new historically minded approach to the comparative study of democratization, centered on the analysis of the creation, development, and interaction of democratic institutions. Historically, democracy did not emerge as a singular coherent whole but rather as a set of different institutions, which resulted from conflicts across multiple lines of social and political cleavage that took place at different moments in time. The theoretical advantage of this approach is illustrated by highlighting the range of new variables that come into focus in explaining democracy’s emergence. Rather than class being the single variable that explains how and why democracy came about, scholars can see how religious conflict, ethnic cleavages, and the diffusion of ideas played a much greater role in Europe’s democratization than has typically been appreciated. Above all, the authors argue that political parties were decisive players in how and why democracy emerged in Europe and should be at the center of future analyses.},
  Annotation               = {\newline Cappocia and Ziblatt make an argument against 1) cross-national studies of democratization using Boix's 0 or 1 approach to transitions and 2) studies that focus on "contemporaneous correlates" of democracy. Instead, building on Pierson, they argue for a study of the sequencing of historical causes, some of which may be "conjuctural", or occuring jointly with other causes. \newline In particular, they argue that socioeconomic development is not as decisive as once claimed, nor do neo-class theories of Boix and A&R do much better. In terms of Europe, the note that political coalitions often extended across class boundaries. Furthermore, they argue that parties are not merely carriers of class interests, but actors in their own right. In particular, they think party ideology is an influential variable in whether or not democracy is adopted. \newline They want to move away from a transitions paradigm to a view of democracy that is built one institution at a time (i.e. institutional complementarity, re: Thelen). Thus they think that democracy can be seen in terms of episodes in Europe, but that these episodes are defined by battles over particular institutional forms. Scholarship will advance as the collective causes of these institutional forms (and the sequencing) is made clearer. They also want to emphasize cases when institutional reform could have happend, but didn't (again echoing Mahoney \& Thelen). \newline I think this work is particularly illuminating for the Middle East. In particular, I wonder if the Middle East could be conceived of as three distinct critical junctures, from the post-WWI, post-WWII, and now the Arab Spring. Looking at the collective ideologies, economic interests and party formation in each period could provide key insight into both how and why democratization (or de-democratization) occurred in the Middle East. Perhaps a better title would simply be "regime transitions in the Middle East." \newline I could use some more work reviewing critical antecedents, Slater \& Simmons, and others. I think I understand it better now as an idea.},

  Year                     = {2005},

  Annotation               = {\newline Capoccia constructs a theory focusing on the defense of democracy from "anti-system" parties. It is heavily based on Sartori's work on parties which polarize democratic systems and force "border parties", or those who are closest to the extremist party, to either leave their coalition and join the extremists or risk a loss of votes. Capoccia examines this trade-off in Finland, Belgium, and Czechoslovakia during the inter-war period. These are cases of "democratic survival", as opposed to breakdown, which occured in Italy and Germany. In particular, he pinpoints the actions of heads of state who were willing to take on the extremist parties with both accomodation and repression--although repression was certainly required for survival. In order for the heads of state to have enough support, the border parties needed to remain in the centrist coalition. Thus he thinks of these moments as critical junctures in which heads of state needed to recognize the seriousness of the extremist problem (instead of just trying to moderate it through institutionalization) and border parties needed to accept a loss of votes in exchange for defending the system. \newline \newline Capoccia believes that this focus on actors complements structuralist theories which can't account for the outcome of these cases (e.g., Moore, Rueschemeyer et al). Critical junctures are when structures cease to have their controlling power. He wants more research done on structured counter-factual analysis exploring times when change occurred and when "re-equilibriation" happened (breakdown averted through the foresight of elites). \newline \newline He does not have a good criterion for determining when and how elites identify the seriousness of the extremist problem. He notes that the extremist parties camouflaged their activities in language supporting democracy. Thus it is not clear why the head of state in Czech was so much more willing to invest his political capital in fighting German extremists than the king of Italy was in fighting the fascists. Critical junctures exist, but what are the factors that influence the difference counter-factuals? That is the essence of manipulationist analysis--knowing what was the hammer which hit the window. The work could be much more structured so as to illumine the specific factors leading the actors to go in the ways in which they did. \newline},

  Abstract                 = {Institutions are rules that constrain political behavior. Although there is consensus that being written down is neither necessary nor sufficient for an institution to be effective, much research on comparative institutions focuses on formal, parchment, institutions. This article argues that parchment can contribute to the generation of shared mutual expectations among political actors, which are essential to the effectiveness of institutions. Next, the article distinguishes between research that emphasizes the role of institutions in aggregating preferences into political decisions and research that relies on coordination models to identify conditions favoring certain equilibrium outcomes when multiple equilibria are possible. The article notes the increasing prominence of such coordination models in research on comparative institutions and concludes with some reflections about the prospects for this trend to foster connections between institutional analysis and the field of comparative politics more broadly.},
  Annotation               = {\newline Carey argues that parchment rules do matter to later political outcomes because of the nature of coordination games, which generate multiple equilibria by nature. Given these multiple equilibria, it is possible that mutually-enforcing expectations can sustain outcomes even when many of the political actors are in disagreement over the imposition of the institution (esp. when these political actors face their own coordination problems). \newline Thus Carey proposes that coordination games resolve the dilemma of endogenous institutions. It is hard for actors to depart from one coordinating equilibrium to another, hence, that coordination equilibrium may last in spite of power imbalances and may perpetuate itself over the long run via path dependence. Carey wants scholars to focus more on the criteria that facilitate equilibrium selection and that generate self-reinforcing expectations producing these outcomes. \newline I like coordination games, but I do wonder if it is possible to focus so much on focal point selection as a mechanism. That is outside of the game and the game makes no predictions about how that happens. Reducing all of institutional theory to equilibriums selection seems a bit obtuse. Nonetheless, it does seem that one thing that sustains institutions over the long run is the tendency of actors to coordinate around them even when they don't like them.},

Thus it uses the same basic coding rules, which are necessary and jointly-sufficient conditions for democracy. Their substantive analysis of this coding decision has not changed. What they do have now is a classification of dictatorships into monarchy, military and civilian regimes. Civilian in this sense is a residual category; they have clear rules for what a military leader is or a king (particularly, if the leader self-identifies as a king), but they argue civilian leadership is too broad (single-party or not)? to provide much utility for classification. \newline \newline They go into much more detail about why they think polychotomous scales are bad. They note that both freedom house and polity use multiple scales additively, which means that there are a high number of combinations which can result in the final aggregate score, but each of these combinations is unique. This permits too broad a range of classifications. They critique papers by Rodrik and others using their new data v. Polity and show that conclusions change significantly as a result. \newline \newline They are no closer to having a clear argument for regimes that have democracies without alternation in power, and they also do not have still back-code democracies as dictatorships (and vice versa) if the party later on either seizes power or gives it up (as in the LDP in Japan giving power up after 50 years). This strikes me as a time-saving device without much basis in fact, and grants agency to parties over politicians. \newline},

  Annotation               = {\newline Cheibub puts forward a convincing critique of Linz's assertion about the negative legacies of presidentialism as a stable form of government. Cheibub alleges that the reason presidentialism is prone to failure is because of its association with 20th-century Latin American democracies, which adopted the institutions when they did because they were the dominant form of democratic government at the time. They proved to be unstable because the military would intervene and undermine democratic leaders, although he does not think that the military designed the institutions this way. Rather, the military is an exogenous factor which has great influence on de-democratization. \newline \newline He puts forward a game-theoretic argument showing that even minority governments under presidentialism may in fact have a ``legislative majority": i.e., enough of the legislators support their policies that they can govern and pass laws. He asserts that presidential systems do also witness coalitions when the other parties are sufficienty far removed from the govt.'s ideal point. Coalitions are constrained by the fact that they have to incorporate the president, but otherwise they are no more nor less likely to form in presidential v. PR systems. He provides convincing quantitative evidence of coalition formation under the two governments. \newline \newline His analysis of democratic transitions is based on the CGV dataset, and incorporates a survival model of transition probabilities over time. Based on their coding, he shows that the existence of a prior military dictator is a strong indicator of reduced longevity. When this variable included, the influence of presidential systems on longevity disappears. \newline \newline what are the actual links between the propensity for militarism and institutions? He does not do a good job defining what this propensity for militarism actually is. He thinks militarism and presidentialism have no connection and jointly produce breakdown. He quotes various theories on the propensity towards militarism but doesn't seem to delineate one. At least, we know he doesn't think presidentialism causes military to intervene (he doesn't want this). He has kind of a ``just-so" story about military interventions starting once and continuing thereon. \newline},

  Abstract                 = {Recent studies indicate that strategic nonviolent campaigns have been more successful over time in achieving their political objectives than violent insurgencies. But additional research has been limited by a lack of time-series data on nonviolent and violent campaigns, as well as a lack of more nuanced and detailed data on the attributes of the campaigns. In this article, we introduce the Nonviolent and Violent Campaigns and Outcomes (NAVCO) 2.0 dataset, which compiles annual data on 250 nonviolent and violent mass movements for regime change, anti-occupation, and secession from 1945 to 2006. NAVCO 2.0 also includes features of each campaign, such as participation size and diversity, the behavior of regime elites, repression and its effects on the campaign, support (or lack thereof) from external actors, and progress toward the campaign outcomes. After describing the data generation process and the dataset itself, we demonstrate why studying nonviolent resistance may yield novel insights for conflict scholars by replicating an influential study of civil war onset. This preliminary study reveals strikingly divergent findings regarding the systematic drivers of nonviolent campaign onset. Nonviolent campaign onset may be driven by separate – and in some cases, opposing – processes relative to violent campaigns. This finding underscores the value-added of the dataset, as well as the importance of evaluating methods of conflict within a unified research design.},

  Annotation               = {\newline They argue that the current emphasis in EITM on model-testing has gone too far. In particular, models are being evaluated solely in terms of their ability to generate statistically significant findings. They assert that models cannot be true or false, they can only be ``useful" according to their purpose. Thus, like Morton, they think there is an adequate role for models that have no empirically observable implications. What is less clear is the standard by which they think models should be evaluated, and what it means for a model to have no truth relevance. It seems that their definition of model evaluation could become hopelessly arbitrary. \newline},

  Annotation               = {\newline In Ch. 2, Coppedge calls for a merging of the "thick" and "thin" approaches to measuring democratization. Thick implies the kind of work that Schmitter and O'Donnell used to do, trying to identify the many features of democracy in a broadly conceptual sense. Thin implies a close link to the Dahlian conception of democracy, particularly in terms of contestation. Coppedge alleges that many quantitative indicators of democracy are unduly biased towards contestation even over the use of inclusion. He also notes that even if there is random error in measurement, quantitative indicators can still have valid results as that only makes it harder to get a true result. \newline \newline Coppedge believes that quantitative indicators should become more complex, have more dimensions, and that a lot more attention needs to be paid to how to aggregate underlying measurements into overall indices. He is critical of indices that use simple averages or additive methods, and he notes that only "ratio" (i.e. interval) measures are fully able to be added or divided without any loss of information. \newline},

  Abstract                 = {How have economic historians understood the role of politics in shaping country differences in economic development? An impressive recent literature can be sorted out according to the degree of “human agency” at work. At the low-agency end are perspectives that stress geography, which is unalterable, leaving little room for human action and hence no room for politics. At the other end are arguments stressing deliberate, self-aware actions, hence choice, hence a substantial role for politics. In between are arguments where some choice occurred in the past or at a specific moment, but little since then. What drives development? Two lines of argument are vigorously debated: explanations that stress human capital and explanations that stress institutions. Within each camp can be found variance on the degree of agency and hence on the role of politics.

We combine information on the spatial distribution of ethnicities before colonization with regional variation in contemporary economic performance, as proxied by satellite images of light density at night. We document a strong association between pre-colonial ethnic political centralization and regional development. This pattern is not driven by differences in local geographic features or by other observable ethnic-specific cultural and economic variables. The strong positive association between pre-colonial political complexity and contemporary development also holds within pairs of adjacent ethnic homelands with different legacies of pre-colonial political institutions.},

  Annotation               = {\newline Elster offers a compelling perspective on explanation in the social sciences that starts from very sparse psychological motivations and moves up to macro social behavior, including collective action. (He does not, though, deal with regime types or changes). His focus on methodological individualism, however, is not easily parsed into a preference for rational choice. Elster is more of a behavioralist, who emphasizes deviations from rationality like prospect theory (loss aversion) and hyperbolic discounting. \newline These two ideas are probably the most damning critiques Elster makes of rational choice. Loss aversion implies that people are much more concerned with relative losses than relative gains. Hyperbolic discounting is a theory supported by experimental research in which the rates of discounting are not constant exponential over time. Rather, the preference for a good may change over time in a non-linear fashion (at least log-linear). Hyperbolic discounting appears to be far more difficult to model in a mathematical sense, and its conclusions are more indeterminate because the functions can take on many different forms. \newline Elster uses a "desire-belief-constraint" model that starts with people's desires, whether rational or not, their beliefs, which he does not attempt to explain from beginning to end, and constraints, which are more objective. He thinks we can learn a lot from psychological models of behavior, and that there is a way in which psychological traits manifest themselves in collective behavior, such as through Kuran's idea of preference falsification (he does not, however, cite Kuran). Emotions, he argues, are able to independently influence action, although only over a short time. While this model is more specific than a rational choice model, it also can be harder to apply because of the complex nature of desires and their interactions with beliefs. \newline Ultimately, I found this book to be a compelling critique of formal modeling and also a way to explore human causality in a more open-ended fashion. It is important to start from the most basic sources of motivation for human behavior and build up from there. The book has a lot less to say about collective than individual behavior, and it has very little to say about ideologies. Elster is adamant, though, that informational complexities do constrain actors in moments of change, and for this reason ideologies can come into play (such as his assertion that constitutional assemblies may be more public-spirited than legislative comittees because of the long-term nature of a constitution). Thus I still think that ideologies may be the true source of exogenous variation in human affairs because of their ability to shape actions at critical moments.},

  Annotation               = {\newline Epstein et al. are primarily interested in taking on Przeworski's earlier argument that income only matters for democratic consolidation, not democratic transition. They critique their use of interactive variables, arguing that effects need to be summed when interactions are used (no mention of interaction graphs, though). They re-estimate using their data and also using a trichotomous measure of Polity IV that allows for a ``partial democracy" category. They think this latter category is important to allow for analysis of regimes which are democratic but not fully so, and they argue that the covariates of democratization are quite different for this category. However, their partition of the Polity IV scale is rather arbitrary--partial is 1 to 7, democracy is 8 to 10, and everything below that is autocracy. So its more like a dichotomous scale where one of the dichotomous categories has two subcategories. Other than that, their statistical models appear to be well-specified, although their approach to using interaction terms is just to drop them into the model until they lose significance and then remove them. \newlinel},

  Annotation               = {\newline Friedman argues that the realism of an assumption is a false metric for understanding theories in social sciences. He makes an analogy to the physics postulation that a ball falling in a vacuum will have a certain velocity, and he argues that this assumption is never found in practice, yet the theory is accepted. He compares this "assumption" to the assumption that people are utility-maximizers. The problem is that the physics assumption is quite literal, while the idea that people are utility-maximizers is impossible to be literal. A more exact analogy would be making a statement about the internal psychological state of the object while it is falling, which isn't an analogy that is possible. Friedman does point out that a good way to test a theory is by its implications, although he notes that some theories cannot be so tested, thus leaving us in a state of ambiguity if our only method of knowing truth is by hypothesis testing. \newline},

  Annotation               = {\newline Geddes et al offer a new dataset specifically aimed at adjudicating between types of authoritarianism. It builds on Geddes (1999) and her work on transitions from different types of authoritarian regimes to democracy. What they argue makes their database distinct is the fact that current datasets, such as CGV, code dictatorship as a residual category. Hence, dictatorship longevity is overestimated because transitions from one authoritarian regime (i.e. civilian to military) will not show up in other datasets. \newline \newline They also argue their coding of different types of authoritarian regimes is more nuanced and detailed than other datasets. For example, they argue that CGV only uses whether a dictator belongs to the military as a marker for military regimes, whereas they look for the existence of a junta, a collegial governing body. However, like CGV, they also have a residual category, which for them is civilian dictatorships. They note there are a broad variety of forms of civilian dicatorships, and so they leave that as somewhat general (although they do distinguish between single party and personalist regimes). \newline \newline Finally, their preliminary conclusions based on their data show that transitions to democracy are more likely when there is less violence (they code how many deaths there are in any transition) and also when transitions happen from military regimes. They argue this is because militaries are better able to shield their leaders from later harm post-transition, whereas personalist regimes are the least likely to do so, hence democratization is less likely (and violent transitions are more likely). \newline},

  Annotation               = {\newline Gerber and Green did a massive randomized study in New Haven of voting turnout behavior. They used mailings, telephone calls and personal visits as treatments, dividing a randomized sample into multiple treatment groups so they could look at interaction effects. They had a very low treatment to intent-to-treatment rate; they argued they could adjust for this by using the rate of later voter turnout among the control and treatment groups as a control for any potential confounders. They also used an IV method based on the same logic -- they selected the members of the treatment group randomly, so they could use the assignment to treatment as an IV for treatment itself. It is a clever idea, although I am not yet sure or convinced of the underlying statistical methodology. \newline \newline Class discussion: They have a very complicated treatments, with multiple conditions re: canvassing, mailings and telephone calls. This means 45 different kinds of treatment according to critics. Their randomization requires them to use multivariate analysis (there is induced correlation in the treatments... or was it error?). These kinds of experiments require a lot of thought and effort. This is an omnibus design that tries to do way too much. \newline \newline They only use the IV on the cavassing. Wouldn't you also need it for direct mail? They don't know whether or not the mail is read in fact. Should they also focus on the ITT for the mail? Or should they look for the CACE? Also, are there multiplicative effects of treatments on each other? They should estimate the turnout for each combination of cells. \newline \newline Re: telephone calls, do we know at all what the message of the telephone call is? That seems to be a missing component of the study. \newline},

  Abstract                 = {This article serves as a companion to the release of Version 3.0 of the Correlates of War Formal Interstate Alliance Dataset, 1816-2000. First released in 1966, the Correlates of War alliance data have greatly influenced quantitative studies of conflict, providing an important variable in the study of international conflict and cooperation. The article begins by describing the historical development and the major characteristics of the alliance dataset. The second section then discusses the procedures used to both identify and code each alliance in this revised and extended version of the data, and this is followed by a description of several important changes made to the original coding rules in order to develop this dataset, with the most notable of these changes being a more determined reliance on treaty texts rather than historical accounts for identification of alliances and alliance types. To show the effects of the revised coding decisions and the enlarged temporal domain, the final section of the article presents summary statistics for the new data and then uses the dataset to revisit two existing studies on democracy and alliance behavior. The findings indicate that jointly democratic dyads are likely to be allied only after 1945; joint democracy is negatively related to alliance formation during the 1816-1944 time period.},

  Annotation               = {\newline Gil-white presented his experiment performed in rural Mongolia. He went to a village that was inhabited by native Mongolians and also by nomadic Kazakhs. His first experiment went poorly after the game (Ultimatum game) was poorly understood by the players. In the second, he did a more sophisticated version in which he recruited members of both ethnicities, and while the game was anonymous, the players knew whether they were making an offer to a someone of their own ethnicity or someone else. The results of the experiment show that players tended to make higher offers to the out group as opposed to the in group, in contradiction to existing theory on in-group bias. Gil-white proposes this is because people of one ethnicity tend to know each other better and thus will make a lower offer as they have a better sense of where the refusal line is. On the other hand, people of other ethnicities are harder to predict, thus to gain any money at all one should make a higher offer. \newline \newline The troubles he had with the first experiment suggest that the field experiment did not work exactly as hoped, and it would be very hard to replicate. This questions some of the findings. He was able to talk to all the members of the experiment afterwards and investigate causal mechanisms, but some of his links between pastoralism as discouraging third-party punishment and the game are hard to substantiate without further fieldwork. Nonetheless, the piece does show the power of using even a simple game experiment in unusual settings. \newline},

Incumbents can decide between targeting funds towards raising awareness of their public goods programs, or by emphasizing ideological distinctions. The crucial difference concerns the position of the median voter. If the electorate is ideologically polarized towards the governing party, then the governing party will allocate funds towards this ``unproductive" use of resources in order to secure re-election. However, if the electorate is balanced around the median voter and the position of the parties (the parties are split in terms of ideology at the median voter), then more public goods will be dispensed.

  Annotation               = {\newline Gingerich offers a differences-in-differences approach to estimating the impact of buying vote brokers in Brazilian gubernatorial elections. He exploits the relevation of a scheme to bribe deputies in a gubernatorial election to use their influence to produce a higher turnout for the governor. He first conditions using a propensity matching technique so that he can argue that like districts would have exhibited a ``parallel-pass" in terms of change over time. He then can argue that this difference is the causal effect because the districts should not have changed differently during the time between treatment and outcome. \newline \newline It is a good paper with plausible conclusions. However he has an odd way of using every variable imaginable to create the propensity scores instead of selecting controls based on theory. He does a simulation in which he randomly selects covariates and the results don't change, but if they don't, why use all the controls? \newline \newline He uses a ``bossism index" to calculate whether someone would have made a likely boss or not, which allows him to match with municipalities that also have bosses. Note he uses a random selection of covariates for the matching technique as a ``robustness check". \newline},

  Annotation               = {\newline Glaeser and Shleifer put forward a model in which politicians have to make a trade-off between electoral support in their own group and electoral support from another group. They are able to finance redistributive transfers from one group to another, which has the effect of causing members of the other group to leave. The decision to leave is a function of the relative wage elasticities: if the English leave, then are more Irish relative to others in the population, and the Irish earn less wages relative to other Irish (this doesn't always seem to make sense). Thus politicians undertake redistribution to ``shape the electorate" when the elasticity of wage is enough to induce some of the other voters to leave (but not too many) and the costs of redistribution are low enough. \newline
\newline They analyze the model with three case studies of U.S. cities: Boston, New York and Detroit. In each of them, a mayor has a decision to either induce the minority to leave (Boston and Detroit) or keep them in office. The case studies are quite informal, and there is no discussion of case selection. \newline},

They select only four variables from a massive list in order to construct what they argue is a parsimonious model able to predict "instability" event onsets. They claim the parsimonious model predicted as well or better than all the other models, although they don't give any reason why. They do try to test their model by dividing the sample, although they only do so along time, not by dividing the sample of countries. Their model is approximately 80 percent accurate at predicting instability when using child mortality, "fractional goverment' (a Polity index), neighborhood conflict, and the Minorities at Risk project data. They offer no convincing theoretical reason for using these variables, arguing instead that prediction proves these variables matter. However there is no explicit comparison of models against each other; we are simply informed that the other variables do not work. There needs to be a much more explicit definition of model-building in order for this piece to hold together. Also, the underlying Polity dataset is suspicious, and the PITF dataset is untested. \newline},

He thinks there are too many possible confounders to state with any certainty what the relative causal weight of institutions is. Thus, nation-building projects are doomed. \newline The problem can be described in terms of what is exogenous, such as extant economic conditions, or endogenous, or the differing effect that environmental conditions have on institutions. (Admittedly, both of these definitions are somewhat vague). He argues that these two problems lead to several confounders of casual inference, including the difficulty of constructing valid counterfactuals that can allay the issues of "treated effect on the treated". In other words, we can't compare democracy v. non-democracy for the same country, so we only know the treated effect on the treated instead of the aggregate treatment effect. \newline However, does his analysis tend to be too pessimistic regarding institutions? It comes back to a fundamental nature of causality and the "order of things". If we expect our knowledge to complete, thorough, and mechanical, then we may never reach that goal. There are too many underlying disagreements about what the fundamental order of things is, even if we did want to go in that direction. Rather, we seem limited to provisional association, a consignment of medium-term causes to medium-term consequences. That may be as far as social science is able and willing to go.},

His model shows how different distributions of thresholds can yield very different collective action movements. Thresholds capture behavior that is influenced by the behavior of others. It may not apply equally to all actors. Hence: "Where the threshold effect is of little interest, and may be said to have been, in effect, falsified, is where all or most of the thresholds are at 0\% or 100\%--that is, where most people's behavior is not, in fact, contingent on that of the others" (1437)},

They claim that many trivial results have been produced in political science because no one has bothered to test these with field research. They call for more funding to be directed at field research instead of surveys. \newline \newline In answer to ethical questions, they argue that we need to consider both the costs and benefits of any experimental intervention, and that the costs are often morally ambiguous (admittedly this part of their paper needs more work). They want people to start small and then work big. In response to external validity challenges, they propose re-doing experiments in different locales, with a nod towards changing publishing rules in order to make this happen. \newline \newline Class discussion: depends on subfield. How would you do one with conflict studies? Works well in development econ and comparative/american politics. Gerber and Green have very much influenced AP. Field experiments are limited in their scope. Their answer to every critique is "do more experiments"... but is that always reasonable? They also downplay theories and their importance in research. But who is the audience then if it is not based on theory? \newline \newline The idea of experimental iteration: are observational studies more important? They are very anti-observational studies and think poli sci hasn't produced much new knowledge. If you do want to do this work, look for institutional opportunities. Especially with aid agencies and international organizations, although you have to cut through the red tape. \newline \newline Ethical concerns: be as minimally intrusive as you can. Is that a criterion? Supposedly these decisions will be made in the political process. But what about minimizing turnout? Would that be a "good" experiment? What are the substantial risks of harm? What is the value to society of your experiment?},

  Annotation               = {\newline Grimmer et al question the neutrality of close elections in Lee and others as a device for testing RDD. They argue that the band at which elections are truly random is uc smaller than many studies predict, and that you need to be much closer to a pure 50-50 split to avoid a discontinuity in sorting during elections. In particular, they run a test on popular bands used in the literature on U.S. House elections and find that even in such ``close" elections, the incumbent party wins more often, which defies the notion of randomness. They also use anecdotal evidence of recent elections which were influenced post-vote by selective counting of absentee ballots, among other quasi-fraudulent mechanisms. \newline
\newline Develop theory of elections through game theoretic model. Incentive to intervene in process in close elections is much higher. Could we detect the type of things they are talking about? They think that state governor/legislature is an important predictor of winning close elections. They look at both variables. They say if you get close enough to the threshold you're OK, but what is close enough? But as you get closer to the threshold, fraud is cheaper because you can influence fewer and fewer votes. Is the problem with the forcing variable? Is margin of victory a good threshold? Implicit assumption is that margin of victory is the same for everyone: this only applies to first past the post with no runoffs. Note that the Brazil paper can focus on only 2-party districts bc there is plenty of data. \newline},

They use a random sample of residents from urban slums which they pre-identified as ethnically diverse. They used large samples (100s of people) and ran them through several games. They were particularly intersted in testing not whether ethnicity has an effect on public goods provision, but how. To that end they postulated different mechanisms, including whether it is due to "strategic selection" (i.e. punishment in repeated play) or preferences (tastes for or against co-ethnics) or technology (ethnicity as means of reaching people "findability" or as a means to solving ends). They designed experiments which tested each of these hypotheses in turn, using a sophisticated strategy which allowed for both anonymous and non-anonymous play. Most of the participants did not know each other. \newline \newline They found that the strategic selection mechanism was the one in which ethnicity had its greatest effect on distinguishing play in both a Dictator game and in a PD game. They divided their sample into "egoists" and "non-egoists" based on observation of a simple dictator game, and they found that egoists were the ones who responded to the threat of sanction when play was nonanonymous. When anonymity was involved, egoists did not care about ethnicity. They also found that findability was an important part of ethnicity in a fascinating experiment where they had subjects try to locate random people in the village. Shared ethnicity made it much more likely they would be found. \newline},

Their point is to test A\&R's argument about regime change. Specifically, they want to code whether movements for change from below had grievances that were in any way about inequality. What is still on the table is whether expressed grievances are not a mask for some deeper, darker motive. This story can become psychological pretty quickly... i.e. is there a greed and grievance component to social movements, only one of which is observable? How cynical should we be of social movements? \newline \newline Note that they say they have CPOs (causal process observations), but there is no dynamic analysis and no representation of what the CPO is from case to case. All we know is that they did research but then they dichotomize their findings across all the cases. Maybe all they are doing is operationalizing and coding cases. What they are saying is that transitions happen without inequality (correct). Second claim is that there are conflicts other than redistributive conflicts, which Ansell and Samuels would agree (property rights may matter--expropriation by the leviathan). Maybe this is non-statistical inference from a cross-sectional dataset. \newline \newline Note that H \& M only look at actor statements which are assumed to be their preferences, thus offering a test of A\&R. But A\&R's model can be true even if actors choose to express their grievances in other terms. However, note that the statistical tests are fairly indirect. But then is the theory non-falsifiable? \newline},

  Year                     = {1982},

  Annotation               = {\newline Hardin provides an elegant analysis and critique of Olson's theory of collective action. He absorbs Olson's framework and then shows its relative applicability to a variety of political situations. He also analyzes Samuelson's theory of public goods, showing that in reality most goods are "collective goods" because they are not strictly non-excludable: e.g., if you really want to you can not consume or consume the public good. He eschews most formal modeling, although he does have some demonstrations of the prisoner's dilemma applied to n-person games. \newline \newline Hardin notably points out that prisoner's dilemmas assume that the good is a step function: in other words, that all must contribute before the good can be provided. In real life situations, this condition may be violated as some contribution may produce some form of the good, although as long as the cost is rising faster than the benefit then it will not be provided. He also notes that if a person can think of their contribution as the "crucial" one in an n-person game, than in expected utility form their contribution may still be "narrowly rational". \newline \newline He also analyzes what he calls "contractarian" motivations (e.g. Kantian fairness) in which the game must be constructed so that each person pays and receives an equal benefit. He shows how logically this is very difficult to construct. He then delves into "extrarational" motivations for collective action, notably "misunderstanding" and "ignorance". Ignorance implies people don't have enough or correct information, thus they cannot adequately asess the costs and benefits in the game. Misunderstanding implies that people have a wrong "causal notion" in their minds. He primarily means that people think they stand to gain more directly from their participation than the prisoner's dilemma implies (thus their assessment of the situation is flawed). \newline \newline He also discusses "participation" benefits, or times when people will join a movement because they believe the movement is "historic", likely to change the present and future course of the nation. He also notes that in large collective action movements, the potential costs are lower as well (some element of the assurance game). Yet these participation benefits are not based on a concrete economic reasoning, and for that reason do not conform to Olson's model. In particular, he notes that this kind of reasoning is more likely in ideological groups than ones in which a concrete public good is being asked for. There are people who engage in collective action out of "altruism" in the sense that they won't benefit directly, but the number of these people will always be small. \newline \newline One intriguing argument he makes is that given this small number of people who ever contribute, the government is the best target for collective action. If you can't stimulate everyone to join you, you can still coerce them to, and you don't need a ton of resources if your end goal is a change in government policy. If that is the end game, then a small number of very highly committed people can change the world. \newline \newline Although if a small number of people manage to change people's views on causal relations, then can't that also have a dramatic effect on collective action? If such misunderstandings are common enough, then there is a way to induce people to cooperate without spending any money at all (beyond what is necessary to spread one's views). \newline},

  Annotation               = {\newline In discussing Sen, Hausman argues against Sen's call for multiple conceptions of the idea of preference in favor of a more multi-faceted definition of preferences. Hausman argues that preferences should be thought of as ''all-things-considered rankings'", in which individuals think through their ideologies, emotions (what Sen calls "sympathy"), moral commitments (for Sen, "commitment") before constructing their rankings. Thus there is a close connection between these kinds of rankings and choice, although there is a difference between these rankings and "revealed preferences". However, because these rankings include moral commitments, they are not merely "expected advantage" rankings, and for that reason cardinal utilities, at least in experimental settings, are not true descriptions of people's actual preferences. He gives a game theory example in which an actor may prefer one outcome over another even though the difference in outcomes depends on the choice of the other person, not her own choice. \newline \newline Hausman also argues that economists should spend more time thinking about how these rankings are constructed and what the internal processes are that produce these rankings. \newlineamongst friend and foe},

They in particular are interested in looking at whether the proportion of offers made and offers received will vary in non-Western settings. They propose that various economic conditions--such as, for example, the relative amount of settled agriculture v. pastoralism--has decisive effects on individuals' willingness to either sanction offenders or to make generous offers. They propose that social units that are relatively autonomous, like families who subsistence farm and trade little, are much less likely to make generous offers than pastoralists who depend on each other for support (or whale hunters who have to hunt as a group). They argue these effects account for the strange variation in experimental outcomes they observe, which differs dramatically from that of experiments performed in Western societies. \newline},

  Year                     = {1970},

  Annotation               = {\newline Hirschman takes on the perfectly competitive economy in his brilliant analysis of two forces which may affect organizations in decline. First, exit, is the force commonly ascribed to economics, in which consumers forsake one company in favor of another. Second, voice, is commonly ascribed to politics, and involves the direct negotation between consumer and firm in order to have the firm change its policies. Hirschman abstracts from these two forces to explain everything from the U.S.' poor performance in Vietnam to the problems facing developing nations in terms of economic growth and monopolies. \newline \newline In general, he does a much better job defining exit than voice. In fact, his analysis of exit as it relates to public goods is particularly cogent. You cannot exit from a public good as by definition it is non-rival and non-excludable. Thus, you always consume it whether you want to or not. Exit implies physically leaving the locality. However, with a private good, you can exit quite easily. \newline \newline There is a trade-off between exit and voice. In some situations, when perfect substitutes aren't available, exit becomes very difficult or impossible. In particular, when there is a decline in the quality of a good, but there isn't another good of similar quality (even if there is another good of lower quality and lower price), consumers who value quality will prefer to stay. Thus voice is tied to the idea of the quality of the good, not only its price. \newline \newline However, what voice is is rather harder to define. It is some kind of direct negotiation between the "consumer" or the "member" and the organization, but what it involves, whether protest, voting, or mere discussion, is not clearly defined in the book. The theory has a lot of utility but the idea of voice needs to be further elaborated. Under what conditions do people use different kinds of voices? Is violence a form of voice? What about extortion? Legal action? Voice is relatively under-theorized compared to exit. However, the contribution of the book is to show that "perfectly competitive" markets, were they to exist, wouldn't be perfect for everyone because some people would prefer quality over quantity, and firms may never have to deal with voice if exit is always an option. \newline \newline The implications for developing countries are clear and profound. If a substitute exists for those who care about quality, then they will emigrate if the quality of the other good is higher and the cost of voice is too high. It seems then that this mitigates against political reformers in poor countries, with attendant results on both the legislature and the bureaucracy. \newline},

  Annotation               = {\newline Holland offers a defense of the causal model he developed with Rubin which can be understood as the potential outcome framework. Holland structures his work around the idea of manipulation--"No causation without manipulation". The manipulation is S, a function, which is defined on all members u of population U. The causal effect is the difference between two values of S, S=t or S=c in terms of the outcome Y (Yt - Yc) for any unit in. If unit homogeneity (SUTVA) holds, a causal effect on one unit is equal to the causal effect on any unit. This is an unobservable difference, hence the "fundamental problem of causal inference". \newline \newline S is different from A, which is another fuction of U which is defined as an attribute of U and cannot be a causal factor (reflected in Woodward). Thus the statement Ya1 - Ya2 is meaningless (although it will produce a real number). For this reason they reject arguments such as causality based on race. Second, they argue one should not mistake Ys (what the observed outcome is) from the unit-level difference between Yt and Yc for any one unit. The causal effect can only be known on average as an expected outcome when it is clear that S is statistically independent of Ys (assignment to treatment or control has no relationship to the outcome variable). Note that causal homogeneity is not needed to assess the average causal effect, but it is to determine whether that average causal effect applies to all units. \newline \newline Randomization is required because otherwise the expectation of Yt - Yc is taken only over a subset of the population U, and it is not clear if this subset is representative of U (as in a statistically representative sample). The causal inference can only be made when S is independent of Ys (either Yt or Yc). That is to say, the expected value of Yt is equal to the expected value of Yt given St (E(Yt) = E(Yt|St). Absent this independence, all that can be calculated is the "prima facie causal effect", not the "true average causal effect". \newline},

  Annotation               = {\newline Modernization causes participation, but modernization is itself uncaused (taken for granted). What does institutionalization cause? Arguably, increased participation and absence of institutionalization cause political disorder. The problem is that political disorder then causes institutions to break down. If the level of institutionalization outpaces participation, you get civil society. If participation outpaces institutionalization, you get praetorian society. Or maybe, institutionalization causes order and participation causes disorder, and you have to wait and see who wins. Or, maybe its the ratio of institutionalization to participation. \newline \newline What does increasing participation look like (from the masses)? Does this participation cause institutionalization? At the very least it causes new conflicts. Perhaps instituationalization is the prescription. But the imposition of institutions needs to be separate from the underlying conflict. Is Hungtington simply promoting a tautology re: institutions are defined by the absence of conflict? Or is he not separating institutions from being either a cause or a symptom of disorder? \newline},

Culture is independent of economics and shows path-dependence. Thus, econ --> culture --> politics, but econ also directly affects politics so culture has an independent trajectory. Relationship is probabilistic without full convergence. \newline \newline On effective democracy -- note that FH scores include a measure of state capacity, thus multiplying the scores by World Bank corruption index is rather odd. Aggregation rule is obscure. There is something wrong as well with the argument on face: many countries democratized before they became post-industrial. What is the causal link btw. self-expressive values and democracy? You want to make your own choices, hence you need institutions to allow you to make your own choices. We have to believe that people made these demands on the system. That demand must create a supply of democracy. Unfortunately, we don't know if the people who led the change to democracy were the ones who also were pro-democratic in terms of culture. This is what Coppedge calls the ecological fallacy. Even if they do demand, why should demand create its own supply? \newline \newline Inglehart recognizes he has 3 threats to validity: 1) endogeneity of time (institutions-->values), 2) autocorrelation (past democracy predicts future democracy) and 3) spurious causation in terms of development (GDP). He uses Vanhanen's index to measure socioeconomic development (very idiosyncratic). He also uses different samples to make different statistical models which he then compares against each other. \newline},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT Domestic politics and international relations are often inextricably entangled, but existing theories (particularly “state-centric” theories) do not adequately account for these linkages. When national leaders must win ratification (formal or informal) from their constituents for an international agreement, their negotiating behavior reflects the simultaneous imperatives of both a domestic political game and an international game. Using illustrations from Western economic summitry, the Panama Canal and Versailles Treaty negotiations, IMF stabilization programs, the European Community, and many other diplomatic contexts, this article offers a theory of ratification. It addresses the role of domestic preferences and coalitions, domestic political institutions and practices, the strategies and tactics of negotiators, uncertainty, the domestic reverberation of international pressures, and the interests of the chief negotiator. This theory of “two-level games” may also be applicable to many other political phenomena, such as dependency, legislative committees, and multiparty coalitions.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT This article argues that when democracy is not yet institutionalized, leaders have little incentive to push for clean elections, in part because they are likely to face accusations of fraud from domestic opposition groups regardless of their true behavior. Reputable international election observers can facilitate self-enforcing democracy by providing credible information about the quality of elections, thus increasing citizens’ ability to coordinate against the regime when election fraud occurs, and discrediting “sore loser” protests. Patterns of postelection protests are consistent with the argument, including that postelection protests are more likely and last longer following negative reports from international observers. International election observers help promote democracy by making postelection protest more accurate in the short term, thereby increasing incentives for leaders to hold democratic elections in the long term. },
  Annotation               = {- they argue that int'l observers lower electoral fraud based on a game-theoretic idea of counterfactuals: leaders anticipate future protests and prefer clean elections with observers - good signals on electoral quality help citizens coordinate on protests - similar to Bou-azizi's self-immolation -time series analysis of elections and post-election protest about fraud},

bridging is important --most interestingly, there was a twenty point difference in the answer to whether it was OK to call for the fall of the PNA among pro and anti regime groups (91) --he thinks that what matters are the institutions that resolve disputes between strangers, not the subjective level of trust in strangers (91) --he notes similar dynamics among NGOs in Morocco (96-7) --using World Values Survey data, he shows that a similar interactive pattern of associations/low trust/high democracy support is happening in Morocco (98-99) --although Morocco has many associations, they still suffer from a polarized political sphere in which their allegiance to the regime is a constant source of contention (107-9) --in Morocco, the govt. uses a divide and conquer strategy: it will give in to concessions to civil society on the condition that civil society remains loyal which Jamal thinks blunts the effect of civil society (109-11) --he notes that associations in Egypt are governed by the 2002 Association Law: ref Singerman, The Politics of Emergency Rule in Egypt -- also, all organizations in Egypt must be licensed by the state (118) -- associational life in Egypt grew a lot in the 1990s (119) -- all CSOs are monitored by the Ministry of Social Affairs in Egypt, unless you corporatize (123) -- arrest of Saad Eddin Ibrahim and the Ibn Khaldoun Center is an interesting case study on regime repression (123) --the 2002 law made associational life more difficult, and banned foreign funding "without government approval" (124) --he argues that many intellectuals are already allied with the state via their employment in "state-sponsored think tanks" and universities (125) --he argues this means that democracy will have an "arduous journey" in the middle east (126) note that his pessimism appears slightly unfounded -- perhaps greater restrictions on associations should lead to higher levels of support for democracy, all things being equal --he does think that trust promotes "civic engagement" (127) --he thinks that bridging and bonding (association type) are less important than linkage to the regime (129) --generalized trust is really an expression of the rule of law (130) --it is important, then, to know what it is exactly that you are putting trust in (131) --the problem then that is democrats become de-contextualized: they are trusting in their place in a world polity that is indicative of Huntington's third wave (132-3) --> look at Della Porta "Social Capital" --he notes that many of the democrats who faced burnout emigrated -- this validates my emigration thesis I was looking at earlier (137) his conclusion: "we still know little about how levels of interpersonal trust aid the journey towards democratization" (138)},

  Abstract                 = {Do foreign media facilitate the diffusion of protest in authoritarian regimes? Apparently for the first time, the author tests this hypothesis using aggregate and survey data from communist East Germany. The aggregate-level analysis takes advantage of the fact that West German television broadcasts could be received in most but not all parts of East Germany. The author exploits this “natural experiment” by conducting a matched analysis in which counties without West German television are matched to a comparison group of counties with West German television. Comparing these two groups of East German counties, the author finds no evidence that West German television affected the speed or depth of protest diffusion during the 1989 East German revolution. He also analyzes a survey of East German college students. Confirming the aggregate-level results, the survey data show that, at least among college students, exposure to West German television did not increase protest participation.},

  Annotation               = {\newline KKG think the most-similar/most-different designs are of limited utility, and instead advocate a statistical understanding of using "controls" in qualititative studies. They think that an explicit recognition of which variables are necessary controls, and then designing the research to incorporate them, is vastly superior to simply choosing most-similar or most-different. They do support a matching idea which is close to the most-similar design, except that they note that doing this can still leave omitted variables which may be even harder to detect because the cases are quite similar. To some extent, their talk of matching approaches that of a natural experiment, in which the difference between cases is assumed to be exogenous. \newline \newline Note that introducing a control can bias the study if you don't have enough cases to balance on. I.e., the story about prisoners--how do you match a person who was supposed to go to prison but didn't? If you can find that person, wouldn't that make them a very unusual case with other variables affecting the outcome? Note that this problem is worse with small-N than large-N. With large-N you have more room to say whether or not a case is anomalous. In other words, the counterfactual must be well-defined: units could have been in either treatment or control. For extreme units, this may not be plausible. \newline},

  Review                   = {This has a great lit review on informational cascades and herd behavior. They note that cascades can also happen locally and note the importance of network cascades that happen over the internet – see W. BRIAN ARTHUR, INCREASING RETURNS AND PATH DEPENDENCE IN THE ECONOMY (1994); Paul A. David, The Hero and the Herd in Tech- nological History: Reflections on Thomas Edison and the Battle of the Systems, in FAVORITES OF FORTUNE: TECHNOLOGY, GROWTH, AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SINCE THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 72 (Patrice Higonnet, David S. Landes & Henry Rosovsky eds., 1991); and Thomas C. Schelling, Dynamic Models of Segregation, 1 J. MATHEMATICAL SOC. 143 (1971). Networking effects do not enter our analysis here. They say that informational cascades can be harmful if and when they are “availability” cascades organized around a single event that is improperly applied. They use the availability heuristic, although Kuran does not think that this makes someone “quasi-rational” (689-90). Rather, it is rational to use only part of your information given the lack of available information. Also, people should care (rationally) about their reputations. They look at case studies concerning instances where scientific evidence contradicted public opinion. This is a bit different than the availability heuristic of the Arab Spring. I.e., was it more rational for people in Tunisia to revolt? If so, why? Was it less rational to “play the lottery” in other countries? He talks about “rational ignorance”. Is the Arab Spring an example of rational ignorance? (704) This assumes that these social movements are successful. They argue from prospect theory that reference points can change people’s utility calculations. “Availability entrepreneurs” are successful when they are able to “induc[e] splits between the private and public ‘selves’ of a sufficient number of people” (727) – in other words, when enough people are willing to forsake their private judgment in favor of public judgment Two things cause information cascades: either caring about social approval or taking your informational cues from what society thinks is true (729) Information affects people’s private risk assessments, and reputational change affects people’s assessment of the costs of their public opinions (729-30) --so what happens when you have an “issue” that has enormously high costs, as in regime change? --as the cascade happens, people with opposing viewpoints are silenced, making the new consensus appear even more credible (730-31) Availability entrepreneurs often rely on symbolic events to start their movement (733) Are availability entrepreneurs mistrustful people who exploit the common consensus, or are they altruistic and committed to a cause (733-34) While sometimes the availability enterpreneurs are shading the truth, they may still result in a socially optimal outcome (735) --so would the Arab Spring be socially optimal? Were the actions of the entrepreneurs in the Arab Spring justified? Did they rely on preference falsification to “get out the vote”? They argue that public policy should not be based on public opinion because of preference falsification (737) Quote: “In and of themselves, people’s words and deeds concerning risks tell us too little about what they truly know, what they sincerely want, and what influences have shaped their dispositions, attitudes, and sensitivities” (740)},

  Annotation               = {\newline Denzau and North propose to provide a preliminary understanding of the limits of "substantive rationality". They propose that ideologies are created by individuals to deal with Knightian uncertainty. These are internal processes of the brain, but crucially, are made into "shared mental models" (SMMs) through communication between individuals. Individuals need to be able to communicate in order to coordinate; thus there is always a payoff to having a shared mental model versus an individual mental model. \newline They believe that Bayesian updating is a limited form of learning which does not capture truly paradigm-shifting knowledge changes, which they term "representational rediscription". A Bayesian update can never change the form of the distribution, only its parameters, thus it is limited. They propose that such rediscription only happens on rare occaisions when it seems that the ideology in vogue has become clearly logically false. Then, there is a quick adjustment to a new mental model in the form of a punctuated equilibrium. \newline They use Arrow's theorem and other conjectures to argue that ideologies are fundamentally complex and therefore can never be fully evaluated. Because of the potential logical inconsistency of any belief there is always the potential for it to change. Thus this change cannot be predicted, but it is almost certain that it will occur at some point due to logical inconsistencies in beliefs. They do not think that such inconsistencies disappear merely with a transition to a "modern" society.},

  Annotation               = {\newline Ladd and Lenz look at the effect of newspaper endorsements on electoral outcomes in Britain. They argue that the shift of some conservative newspapers in favor of Labor's candidate had a strong effect at increasing votes for the Labor candidate over those voters who read newspapers that did not switch. To find the effect the use a British longitudinal study of election voters in which they are able to see what newspapers people read over time and how that correlates with later voting behavior. \newline \newline Treatment is clearly not randomly assigned. Newspaper readership is clearly endogenous. That is where matching is key. Good estimate for a token cause, but hard to generalize because it measures a single event, which is a conservative paper endorsing a liberal candidate. The usual ``endorsement treatment" is when a paper endorses a candidate in line with their general political stance. The rarity of the event is what allows them to find such a large, measurable effect. Note there is a problem with attrition--people may be opting out of the treatment group after the sun changed its editorial policy. This would over-estimate the level of voting. \newline \newline Endogeneity of treatment: is the newspaper anticipating the change of their voters and thus their editorial stance reflects underlying discontent? \newline},

Although the fact of anarchy remains a truism for the system as a whole, it is a fallacy of division to infer that all relationships within that system are anarchic. Building on an alternative view of relational authority and recent research on the practice of sovereignty, a new conception of international hierarchy is developed that varies along two continua defined by security and economic relations. This construct is operationalized and validated, and then tested in a large-nstudy of the effects of international hierarchy on the defense effort of countries. The principal finding is that states in hierarchical relationships spend significantly less on defense relative to gross domestic product than states not in such relationships. In short, hierarchy matters and subordination pays; states appear to trade some portion of their sovereignty for protection from external security threats.

  Review                   = {- they distinguish competitive from hegemonic regimes in that hegemonic regimes may have elections which are only a facade (5-7) - in a competitive regime, fraud in elections occurs, but it is not enough to ensure an outcome. They quote Serbia and Ukraine as having elections with "only" 10% of electoral fraud (8) - they expand the static conception of democratization slightly by including some measure of substantive democracy: i.e., a "level playing field" between the regime and the opposition (6) - Egypt is not a comp authorit regime (8) - violations of civil liberties happen constantly in comp authorit, sometimes leading them to "the brink of authoritarianism" (8) - Russia is the big example of violations of civil liberties, which can take "legal" forms (9) - there are three components of an unlevel playing field: 1) "access to resources" - the state can use its own finances, and monopoly business powers, to dramatically outspend opponents (10-11) 2) "access to media": the state has some kind of control over media, whether formal or informal (11) 3) "biased referees: uneven acess to the law:" states can control the judiciary and electoral commissions, sometimes coopting them and sometimes intimidating them (12) - Thus, comp authorit regimes still have "real but unfair" competition: "In compet authorit regimes, incumbents are forced to sweat" (12) - thus, even regimes with leader turnover via elections may still be undemocratic (13) - their idea to use compet authorit, instead of some adjective for democracy, comes from Linz, who think that we should be careful to separate these regimes from true democracies. Note that this comes from a "procedural minimum standards for democracy" (14-15) - they exclude Egypt because they pose a distinction with "electoral authoritarianism", which may or may not be truly competitive. Competition has to exist for the executive (16) - they argue that even if the concept is "narrow", it is useful because it applies to a lot of post-Cold war regimes (16) - they note that Western hegemony led to "the diffusion of Western democratic models" (17) -although, this diffusion happened because of regimes competing for development aid (17) - he notes that IOs and NGOs played a big role in this by exposing authorit regimes' corruption (subjecting them to a loss of aid) and leading to more electoral observers, who lowered fraud (18) - this pressure was uneven (it did not exist in the Middle East), and it focused too much on the happening of elections (19) - they note that this democratic pressure resulted in comp authorit because of a lack of "a strong civil society and effective state institutions" -- this seems like a big residual in the model (19) -- leverage has to do with how "vulnerable" a country is to pressure from the West: i.e., if you don't have a second, stable source of rents (or a foreign backer), you are in trouble (41) --linkage has four components: economic, intergovernmental (treaties, military relationships), technocratic (elite educated in the West), social (people flows across borders (43) --linkage is the defining variable: when it is high, countries will democratize at some point. if it is medium or low, then org power is determinative (strength of regime). only if the regime is weak does leveverage play a role, but leverage is only able to produce 'unstable authorit", not true democracy (72) -- the difference between linkage and leverage is due to information costs: when linkage is high, Western regimes are more aware of what is happening (he cites Mexico gubernatorial elections), which makes leverage much more effective (51) gubernatorial elections (45) -- also, linkage creates a domestic constituency because people identify themselves with the linked country, which is democratic (47-49) Eastern Europe case study --they argue that E.Europe was not a good candidate for democratization in the 90s because it was too poor, had a Communist legacy and suffered from conflict (87) --a big part of Western influence over E.E. countries was E.U. conditionality (88-89) --however, the E.U. conditionality was greatly helped by societal level linkage (90-91) -- he rates Slovakia as high linkage, no black knights (Russia failed to deliver), and Meciar's party as "medium high" (93) --they say that Meciar enjoyed broad economic support, but that is not what I remember (93-94) --he argues that Meciar wanted to be more authoritarian than he could be because of Western and E.U. pressure, and ultimately he could not form a new govt. because of his stance on E.U. integration (95-96) --it appears a bit deterministic... was E.U. conditionality really necessary for Slovakia to democratize? would it have democratized anyway? --Romania was very vulnerable to leverage, and become more linked post-independence. their org power was medium and their coercive was medium as well (98-99) --he argues that Romania started off with a weak civil society, but E.U. assistance built it up, so that by 1996 the leader had to leave power peacefully (100-102) --eventually, E.U. conditionality promoted free and fair elections and transitions in power despite a relapse to compet authorit. (102-104) --they argue that Serbia is a case of high leverage and linkage, but that foreign policy goals prevented leverage from taking place until Milosevic had been removed. also, party and coercive strengh high in serbia (105-106) --he makes the argument that Serbia was still "free enough" to allow real competition in elections (107) --economic collapse made his anti-West position unpopular, and when his govt. tried to steal the elections in 2000, massive protests broke out (110-112) --he thinks that this means that the end was lack of org strength as his regime fell apart due to int'l isolation (112) --although Albania was originally cut off from the West, it opened up after the wall fell and then the West had more linkage--leverage was always high due to its small economy (118-20) --foreign intervention stepped up after Albania descended into anarchy, but it still took until 2005 before there were truly fair elections (122-123) --another coding problem: Albania is labeled as "nearly democratic" in 2008 (123-124) -- what does that mean? doesn't that relate to their own criticism of "adjective" democracies? --similar to Albania, Macedonia had internal problems in the early 2000s that led to serious foreign intervention. By 2008, they argue Macedonia had fully democratized (126-128) summary of european countries: 128 --the only country they don't predict is Albania, which they say is "nearly" democratic: over-reach? (128-129) --they argue that E.U. conditionality mattered, but only in the context of high linkage (129) --interestingly, they note that Slovakia could be explained by high GDP growth (129)--although they mention the lack of FDI --similarly, U.S. leverage in latin america only mattered in the context of high linkage (131) --they think that Dom Republic, Nicaragua and Guyana are all small countries with high leverage and linkage because of how small they are. this is comparable to Croatia, Romania, Slovakia (132) --The D.R. was dominated by the U.S. for a long time, ensuring absurdly high levels of linkage, and the regime was not that strong, eiher (133-4) --he notes that in the D.R., the civil society was weak, but this seems to be a standard explanation without much context. Is there a reason that the civil society is weak? (135) --he notes that the D.R. slid back into comp authorit, and then U.S. pressure reversed its course--but why did it slide back into compet authorit if linkage was so high? (135-137) --Nicaragua was a poor candidate for democracy due to a prior war (137) --he notes, however, that both leverage and linkage were high, esp since the U.S. cared a great deal about the civil war there (138-139) --he argues that high linkage, including election observers, made the 1990 elections free and fair even if the Sandistinas wanted to win. also, voters wanted to re-integrate with teh U.S. (141-143) --he notes that Nicaragua tried to move back to compet authorit, but "capital flight" restrained the country (144-145) --they note that Guyana became compet authorit in the 60s b.c the U.S. did not want a Marxist challenger to win (147) --they note that although the U.S. had low leverage over Mexico, it had very high linkage, including have all the elites educated in the U.S. -- does this really matter (150-51) --he thinks that Mexican party and coercive was very high because of "revolutionary" origins" (152) --they think that although the U.S. never adopted a policy of democratization, linkage made a difference through NAFTA--now investors and Congress cared about politics in Mexico (154-156) --although the PAN was based on a new middle class, they don't think that economic change was determinant, but rather the pressure faced by the PRI by int'l observers (159) --thus, the PRI negotiated for openness in 1996 (159) --although he can't predict Peru b/c of medium linkage and uneven use of leverage, he thinks that Fujimori lacked legitimacy because he relied on patronage and never building a strong party (163) -- although Fujimori was denied a coup due to int'l pressure, he did build a large security apparatus to monitor opponents (163-66) --the weakness was the lack of a successor: without Fujimori there was no movement (166) --he can't explain why "medium linkage" didn't put much of a constraint on Fujimori, other than that it is medium (167)--note that Fujimori's party was explained as weak in cohesion --Fujimori fled after a corruption scandal... and then Peru democratized, which they note was a cause of linkage... although linkage had been present for some time (169-70) cohesion seems to be a post-hoc explanation--if Peru had democratized due to linkage, would they have used that to explain it? --they note that Haiti's problem was that it had a very weak state, and they say that linkage was medium because it existed mostly on the social level, not among elites (169-73) -- this seems like a good way to differentiate linkage --also, they say that Haiti's civil society was weak--again, why? internatinal assistance was readily available (174) --although Haiti did not democratize, they argue that it did collapse--is this still confirmation of their theory (176-77) --they say that inequality was high among all the Latin american countries they looked at (177) --they also say that Venezuela fell into compet authorit because leverage was low although linkage was high--does this imply that there needs to be at least a minimal level of leverage? (178-179) --they don't think that popular mobilization--color revolutions--explains authorit persistence in post-Soviet countries (184) --elite levels and social levels of linkage were low (184) --Russia was also a black knight in these countries (185) --only in countries with weak regimes actually democratized to some extent (186) --he notes that social linkage was low, and says that none of Yeltsin's cabinet studied in the West--although many Russians did do that (Fulbright fellowships) (187) --russian party strength started weak with Yeltsin and became stronger with Putin, although it was non-ideological (188-189) --russian strength went from "medium low" to "medium high" -- what is the scale for these variables? (190) --he argues that the limited period of democracy under Yeltsin was due to state weakness, not to any actual democracy in pratice (196-197) --he argues that as Putin made the state stronger, electoral compet declined (198) --he doesn't think that the economy is what made Putin strong, but rather party-building (200) --he makes a good point that Belarussia shows Russian influence at staving off Western efforts to promote democracy, leaving leverage low (206) --they think Armenia had only medium linkage because their trade was "half" that of Eastern Europe's (207) -- this is a relative, not absolute standard --Armenia used a military forged in conflict (Nagorno-Karabakh) to defeat oppositions despite party weaknesses (209) --they argue that this lack of linkage explains why the West did not notice what happened in Armenia (213) --Ukraine has low linkage because it never had E.U. conditionality and it never had "formal" treaties with the West (214) --they think that Ukraine's orange revolution is really just a sign of prior regime weakness: opp strength is endogenous to Kuchma' inability to build a strong party and find a successor. Western support existed but was not decisive (in their eyes) (218-220) --similarly, they think that Georgia's rose revolution was small and only successful because the state was so weak, although they acknowledge that Western support had a "secondary role" (225-226) --becasue of a lack of linkage, Western leverage was ineffective in Georgia (228) --they did not predict Ukraine's democratization: not enough linkage (233) --African countries were unlikely to democratize because of low linkage, but they were unstable because of weak states/parties (237) --it is not clear why linkage is listed as low in Cameroon when half of its trade went through France (258) --he argues that France was the "black knight" that enabled the regime in Cameroon to survive repeated oppositions, but why is France non-democratic? (260-61) --also, ethnic politics prevented the rise of a strong civil society (263) --he thinks that oil rents made Gabon secure, but does the presence of oil rents ensure strong parties/org strength? (263-65) --Kenya and Senegal democratized because they did not have a "black night" patron like France (265) --but, lack of linkage prevented later regimes from embracing democracy (265) --he notes that Moi faced conditionality from the West, but also a stronger opposition in the 90s --again, why is is stronger? (269) --nevertheless, they think that elite defections were ultimately determinant in Kenya (271) --they note that modernization played a role in Taiwan (309) --but, it was Taiwan's high linkage that led to democratization -- why is this linkage higher than in Kenya, for example? --they do provide good evidence at exceptional linkage btw. Taiwan and the U.S. (309-312) -- they seem to really value formal linkage --they note that civil society grew with the middle class, the first time they say why civil society expanded (313) --they note that Taiwan cared about what the U.S. thought, but they also note that leverage is questionable--would the U.S. really drop Taiwan? (314-315) --like Peru, Taiwan's KMT fell to a corruption scandal, which they label as "contingent" (317) -their analysis of modernization in East Asia is vague (337) --their results are 28 out of 35 correct predictions (340) --they seem to have a hard time predicting results when regime capacity is low and linkage is low (340) --results p. 341 --Peru democratized despite "only" medium linkage -- what is medium? why not just low/high? (342) --Ghana is an interesting divergent case because it appeared to have a benevolent ruler who democratized "just so" (343) --when state capacity increases, it also becomes more stable (particularly with parties) (343-44) --linkage can explain differences in countries that very comparable in other criteria (344-45) -they think that countries were poor enough in their sample for modernization theory to have no relevance (346) --economic crisis only matters when prior regime capacity is weak (or low cohesion) (346) --opp strength is endogenous to org strength -- opp movements succeed when elites defect bc of weakness in the prior regime (348-50) --they note that over time, a stronger domestic opp could lead to democratization, which their theory does not predict or cover (351) --where linkage is low, leverage does not work, explaining why some studies have difficulty showing effects. they note that this means that policies of isolation to undermine authorit countries are unlikely to work (352-53) --they think that prior state capacity matters to democratization "rotten door transition": weak opps mean that they can't countervail state power (how?), there is "little elite turnover", and those who do take government generally use it as they find it, resulting in no difference in regime type (355) --but if you had a strong regime, why would you want to change it? --"hard door" transitions to democracy need a strong civil society, even if they are less likely to happen overall (p is low) (356) --strong parties often build good electoral institutions because they are convinced they can win (356) --thus, democratization can happen from above (357) --however, state-building can also promote stable authorit countries, not just stable democracies (357-58) -- i.e., Russia --formal institutions only matter in these countries when parties are weak and regimes c/n overturn their own rules (359) --they predict that Cuba will become a democracy because it has such high linkage to the U.S., although it needs to go through a transition bc it has a party that has an ideology formed in revolution, making it strong (361) --they think that Cuba, North Korea and China all show this trend --they think that the favorable in'tl environment for democracy is eroding (China), which means fewere compet authorit countries, although not necessarily more authorit countries overall (changes in style, not type) (363-64) --doesn't the changes in their book mean that linkage should have an exponential growth for democracy? as linkage grows, so should more democracies? need to use a disease model to explain democracy},

  Review                   = {--Lichbach thinks that "conflict studies" (i.e. sociology and poli sci) never fully integrated Olson's concern for microfoundations. Tilly's group-based approach doesn't really cut it (8-11) he posits a "five percent rule" --in a given context, only five percent of individuals or groups will participate to supply a PG (18-19) he thinks there are four possible solutions to the rebel's dilemma: 1) Market, i.e., unplanned and uncoordinated, 2) community, planned through loose social networks, 3) contract, planned by "associational relationships" and 4) hierarchy, some form of formal institution (20-21) i.e, market = "state of nature, community = "civil society", contract = "constitution", hierarchy = "state" (21) he argues that "dissident groups" are always experimenting with approaches to solve the CA problem, hence, social darwinism ensues in that only the efficient roups survive (26) solving the PD can corrupt organizations, thus making things worse in the long run even if the PD is solved (29) crucially, he notes that the PD problem goes away "when almost all potential dissidents are actual dissidents". this is a nod ot the assurance game and means that there is a point at which the costs of participating become zero -- which is precisely the situation I want to explain: when does participation far exceed the five percent rule (39) dissident groups want to lower the cost of participating: i.e., they want to find whatever form of CA is cheapest for people. (this may explain why the internet brought great turnout in Mubarak's Egypt). (40-42) spontaneity of protest activity is precisely what makes it safe and low-cost (46) he argues that dissident groups have "production functions" (repertoires of collective action), and they can turn out a lot more if they can figure out new technologies of dissent (50-51) he lists numerous benefits to collective violence, but all of that makes it seem as though most groups would be violent (54-59) Again, he echoes Medina's concern about winning in the PD game "Rational dissidents do not participate in losing causes" (62) Thus, quick-forming movements have to do with the "probability of winning": "Sudden outbreaks of collective dissent are therefore better explained by updated estimates of success than by recalculations of utility" (65)},

  Annotation               = {\newline Lichbach sets out his own philosophy for research programs in political science. He is also writing against rational choice theorists who he accuses of "hegemonic" positivism, such as Bueno de Mesquita. He argues for a "modest" rational choice which recognizes that other research traditions, notably culturalism and structuralism, offer competing and incompatible explanations for social phenomena. Instead of promoting synthesis, he believes that research programs should recognize other potentially competing views and attempt to adjudicate between explanations. This kind of competition is ultimately what spurs scientific advancement (Popper). \newline To this end, he delves into epistemology and the nature of research. He argues for a middle ground between positivism and relativism in which theories can apply to multiple cases (and even cross research traditions) but a single, axiomatic theory of human behavior is unlikely to be found. He relies heavily on Weber, stating that the different research traditions can be understood as ideal types which may be more or less applicable in different situations. However, the types cannot simply be merged into each other. Each type has a "thin", or pure version, and a "thick", or mixed version in which synthesis is attempted. He tends to argue in favor of thin versions of theories so that they can remain empirically testable and understandable. \newline As a critique of rational choice, he does a good job showing why mathematical arguments will never be able to capture the full range of human thought and experience. Although he is for rational choice, he is willing to admit this much and to open the door to competition among research paradigms. It is a thought-provoking book and one that makes me question my own approach to research questions. Keeping the traditions clear is a good strategy to use for research in my own work. \newline},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we address the general question of how social influence determines collective outcomes for large populations of individuals faced with binary decisions. First, we define conditions under which the behavior of individuals making binary decisions can be described in terms of what we call an influence-response function: a one-dimensional function of the (weighted) number of individuals choosing each of the alternatives. And second, we demonstrate that, under the assumptions of global and anonymous interactions, general knowledge of the influence-response functions is sufficient to compute equilibrium, and even non-equilibrium, properties of the collective dynamics. By enabling us to treat in a consistent manner classes of decisions that have previously been analyzed separately, our framework allows us to find similarities between apparently quite different kinds of decision situations, and conversely to identify important differences between decisions that would otherwise appear very similar.},

  Annotation               = {\newline Lyall uses a matching algorithm to match districts that suffered Russian artillery fire during the Chechnyan civil war as a way to determine if this type of indiscriminate shelling can reduce the number of insurgent attacks. He finds that it does, and he compares a simple difference of means (arguing that the artillery fire was effectively random) and also a matching algorithm balancing on some covariates of likely involvement of insurgent groups, which yields a similar estimate. It is a pretty convincing argument regarding the effect of artillery fire on later insurgent action. \newline \newline Interesting policy implication. The nature of the phenomenon might violate SUTVA upon which the analysis is implicitly based. There is probably a substantial degree of mobility of insurgency. Why wouldn't attacks on one village affect attacks in another village? What if the insurgents are simply learning where the artillery is and how to avoid them? Do insurgents have to be exactly local? \newline},

Also, he argues that the Arab Spring has led to much more external intervention of Arab states into each others' countries as former norms of sovereignty have fallen (particularly the expulsions of Syria and Libya from the Arab League for abuse of protesters). (7-28) Lynch also acknowledges that many regimes were apparently stable in the immediate period before the uprisings (re: Egyptian elections), although he argues that ongoing protest movements were gaining support in the 2000s (67) he notes that in the beginning of the protests diffusion, it really did seem that other countries were happening on the same timetable: "On an average Friday in 2011, virtually every city in the Arab world marched to the same beat, chanting the same slogans, watching each other, and feeding off a shared energy within a shared narrative" (69) he notes that Tunisian media, including the internet, was heavily censored by the government prior to the outbreak of the revolution (74) essentially, the Tunisian revolution started when a fruit vendor self-immolated, and this prompted initial protests which were repressed heavily by the regime. in this context, the repression led to a cycle of further turnout (75-76) interesting, the Saudi owner publicly speculated about the "domino theory" (p. 80) --},

  Annotation               = {\newline Marshall and Stacher come up with a convincing array of evidence that the Egyptian military has been expanding their holdings in commerce in Egypt over the past ten years. In fact, they allege that the military manouvered the transition so as to protect their holdings and to prosecute (i.e., via anti-corruption) those who could compete with them for state contracts. The military has been active in partnering with international firms in an array of services, including oil \& gas, which is giving them yet more power and reasons to secure the state. \newline
\newline Note, however, that this truth about the military is under-theorized. We don't know quite why the military got here (other than Nasser's historical legacy) and we don't know how likely the military is to stay here. But it does seem like these economic interests are a powerful counter-weight to the democratic impulse of the citizenry. \newline},

However, Masoud does not perfectly agree with Lust's thesis that Egypt's relative lack of leftist parties is due entirely to authoritarian repression, because he thinks that leftist parties can also respond in the same way to patronage by offering goods and services to voters (25). Rather it is the obstruction of the formation of social networks which would link leftist parties to voters that is the key obstruction to the rise of leftist parties, which he believes are necessary for a pluralist democracy (xiv). \newline},

  Annotation               = {\newline The authors make a strong defense of and apology for rational choice theory as it was developed by William Riker at the University of Rochester, where de Mesquita went to school. They argue that Riker combined previously existing elements of basic game theory and social choice theory (Arrow, von Neumann, Downs) into a new "positive political theory" which emphasized explanation over normative claims regarding democracy. \newline They assert that this paradigm has revolutionized political science and also led to much greater understanding of political science. However, the essay is very strong on explaining the historical origin of rational choice and less strong on the successes of positive political theory. They note that there was an emphasis on prediction and that the theory provided some falsifiable conclusions about American politics, but there is little else in the way of what the discipline has contributed. Given the absence of clear predictive successes, I think that the extraordinary claims of this article need to be couched in some tentative words. Rational choice may be a dominant paradigm in political science, but it is far from able to explain what is happening in the wide, wide world.},

  Publisher                = {Beacon Press: Boston.},
  Year                     = {1966},

  Annotation               = {\newline Moore presents a series of case studies illuminating the role of different classes in either moving to modernized, liberal democracy or to dictatorship. While he draws heavily on Marx and Weber, he is independent of either, sometimes referring to classes in a Marxist sense but also privileging more heavily the role of the state. He offers a series of case studies relaying how states moved from pre-modernity into modernity. Depending on whether this process removed the role of the landed elites--i.e., what role they played in this transition--a country would be able to make the ``successful" transition to English-style parliamentary democracy, or it would fall back into dictatorship. In either case, Moore believes that modernity entails a violent destruction of the old order. There is no peaceful path to modernity. \newline
\newline England is the successful transition because the landed aristorcracy were able to convert their system of feudal domination over peasants into a modern cash economy. This started with the wool trade which forced landowners to begin enclosing their land and enforcing property rights (this caused violence among peasants, but never outright revolution). Thus when industrialization began in the 19th century, the elites were able to transition to new modes of production because they were not invested any longer in a system of feudal privilege. Thus this drive for rationalization led to the adoption of democracy (although it took a certain amount of inter-class maneouvering and politicking to occur). \newline
\newline France, by contrast, never had a landed aristocracy which invested itself in agricultural development. Rather, the rule of the different French kings centralized the system by pulling the nobility away from their land. This led to a weakened nobility that rented out much of its land to peasants. As the peasants grew stronger, the nobility simply kept the old system of feudal privilege intact. Finally, , the revolution broke out, which Morore is quick ot point out was supported by the ``wealthy" peasants who had land from the nobility. It wasn't until the revolutionary government began to expropriate food from the countryside that it alienated these peasants and eventually led to a revolutionary reaction. Because France had not disestablished its feudal system, the revolution occurred as a spasm as pent-up forces were unleashed. \newline
\newline Moore cites the civil war in the United States as the final reaction of the landowning elites in the South to the threats of modernity. Although he does emphasize the role of slavery as key to starting the war, he also asserts that the different economic bases between the North and the South predisposed elites on both sides to see each other as a threat. As the North decoupled its industrial economy from the South, it developed stronger linkages with the West which enabled it to view the South as more evil and inferior. Moore also points out that the civil war itself did not fully remove the power of the landlords because elites in the north did not see that in their interest. Thus reconstruction was a failed endeavor and southern elites were later able to re-establish control. \newline
\newline Moore struggles more with China as he has to fit European frames onto the Asian case. He does think, like in the French case, that the rise of the Communists in the 20th century was a reaction to the remains of a pre-modern era (although he does not call the Imperial order a feudal order per se). The Imperial system, he argues, was very weak, and particularly struggled with adequate tax collection. Thus the landed nobility were allowed to remain in charge, and similar to the other cases, they had no interest in modernizing land holdings and instead extracted as much surplus as they could from peasants without pursuing modernization. The final blow to the Imperial Order was the Japanese invasion, but Moore believes that elite weakness was the true cause of the later collapse of Kuomintang and the rise of the Communist dictatorship. \newline
\newline In Ch. 7-9 Moore puts forward a theory that covers transitions to dictatorships and democracies, as well as a theory of peasant revolution. The two are very similar. He sees peasant revolutions as a factor which can occur during transitions to modernity. He holds a more or less rationalist account that peasants make calculations between revolting and considering the benefits their rulers bring them in the present. When rulers only extract surplus, or lose some of their meaning to absolutist monarchies, peasant revolt is likely to sweep away feudal systems. Moore also emphasizes, again, that the commercial nature of the aristocracy is critical to either encouraging peasant revolt or denying it. When elites are invested in commercial agriculture, they can use ``economic" means to stay ahead, such as contracting out for labor, which agricultural-repressive systems (Germany, U.S.) cannot afford to do. Thus the British never exploited their peasants during industrialization (although they did during the enclosure movement). What the enclosure movement did was free peasants from their land, thus creating enough of a labor supply to make English agriculture competitive at the global level. \newline

\newline class discussion: this is a four actor model: the state, bourgoise, peasants, the king. The state: is it autonomous? It is mostly just a repressive apparatus. We don't know why it will do what its supposed to do. What do the peasants do? They will rebel, but someone has to organize the peasants. Peasants don't have much agency in the book. The nobility extracts resources from the peasants, absence of commercial revolution the nobility has to extract these resources through the state (repression). Absent feudalism they can't keep repressing. Bourgeoise primarily have to be indepenent of the state, that will cause the nobility to be independent as well and eventually dissolve into the bourgoise. The bourgoise have to dissolve the state-aristocracy alliance (the English case). Initial condition: a crown-nobility alliance which will extract rents and won't permit democracy to happen. \newline

\newline Note that to make the argument apply in China, he has to equate the aristocracy with the scholar-gentry. They are the ones who ally with the state (or the Samurai in Japan). He goes back to the commercial revolution in England and claims that is exogenous: although it might not be. However, the landed gentry is autonomous by the 17th century, but democracy does not arrive until the 19th century. If no early internal commercial impulse, then the landed gentry has to ally with the state. It also opens the door to the revolution depending on the `strength' or `solidarity' of the peasantry. If the peasants are strong enough, you get revolution and potentially communism. If no capacity, you get fascism. \newline},

  Abstract                 = {Our society is increasingly relying on the digitized, aggregated opinions of others to make decisions. We therefore designed and analyzed a large-scale randomized experiment on a social news aggregation Web site to investigate whether knowledge of such aggregates distorts decision-making. Prior ratings created significant bias in individual rating behavior, and positive and negative social influences created asymmetric herding effects. Whereas negative social influence inspired users to correct manipulated ratings, positive social influence increased the likelihood of positive ratings by 32\% and created accumulating positive herding that increased final ratings by 25\% on average. This positive herding was topic-dependent and affected by whether individuals were viewing the opinions of friends or enemies. A mixture of changing opinion and greater turnout under both manipulations together with a natural tendency to up-vote on the site combined to create the herding effects. Such findings will help interpret collective judgment accurately and avoid social influence bias in collective intelligence in the future.},

  Annotation               = {\newline Munch and Verkuilen dig deep into existing democracy indices. They are highly critical of Freedom House and moderately critical of others, arguing that methodological decisions regarding democracy measurement have not reflected well-thought out trade-offs. \newline \newline They use a framework for measurement that involves defining the concept and all attributes of the concept, which involves a tree-leaf structure as the definition moves from the concept to lower-order attributes of the concept ("level of abstraction"). At the bottom level of abstraction, indicators should be chosen to reflect the abstraction of the concept at its lowest level. However, he notes that then the disaggregated attributes and their corresponding rules need to be aggregated together using a rule so that the index reflects the overall power of the concept. A lot of studies, if not most, do not use clearly defined aggregation rules. \newline \newline He wants researchers to avoid the dangers of "maximalist" definitions: "too many attributes" v. "minimalist" definitions: definition applies to too many cases. He notes that minimalist can also fail, as some, like Polity, include only contestation instead of participation, and others, like CGV, use a definition of "offices", or the number of offices which are actually elected. Thus it is hard to come up with truly minimalist definitions of democracy. \newline \newline Given the leaf-tree structure, there are two basic problems with measurement, and that is "conflation" (attributes lumped together without reason) and "redundancy" (identical attributes in different branches). Unlike others, he is not in favor of ratio scales, and instead argues that scales should have the minimum number of distinctions necessary to measure the concept adequately. \newline},

(xii) tactics of nonviolence: "Generally, civil resisters use three types of 'non-violent weapons': (1) protests and persuasion; 2) noncooperation (such as boycotts, strikes, civil disobedience, and so forth); and 3) nonviolent intervention, which includes physical disruptions (such as sit-ins) or the building of parallel social institutions" (xii) look at Stephan and Chenoweth (2008, 2012) on the role of nonviolence in social movements --they argue that nonviolent methods may take a long time, but so do violent methods (xiii) aslo look at Karatnycky and Ackerman (2005) on why democracies established by nonviolent movements are more stable Gene Sharp was a key theorist of nonviolence in the 1970s, he proposed that the state depends on society and that the society can refuse to cooperate with the state (xv) thus, "all states are in a precarious situation" (xv) Sharp doesn't deal with other sources of regime power, including external support (xvi)},

  Annotation               = {\textbf{Hypothesis} \newline. Political pacts between the opposition and authoritarian elites will cause democratic transitions to be more stable and more enduring. \newline An opposition which has a too strong performance in a founding election after a transition from authoritarianism will jeopardize the democratic transition by causing a military coup. \newline
\textbf{Measurement} \newline
This book is written as an unstructured essay without much explicit attention to measurement. The authors do define major concepts, including transition, liberalization and democratization. Transition is the movement from one regime to another, liberalization the extension of political rights, and democracy the extension of citizenship. They do separate the substantive from the procedural aspects of democracy (they term the substantive aspects "socialization" as opposed to democratization). Their identification of democracy is broadly in line with the Dahlian conceptions of contestation and participation.
\textbf{Research Design} \newline
They do not take on independent research for this review but rather use studies which were complied for a four-volume set by John Hopkins Press in the 1980s. That study focused on democratizations in Latin America and Europe, thus a particular attention to Greece, Portugal, Spain and Brazil, Argentina, Peru and Chile. Their work summarizes these findings, but their use of the research is primarily in the form of anecdotes rather than rigorous comparison. \newline
\textbf{Findings} \newline
O'Donnell and Schmitter set out to describe transitions in Latin America and Europe in the past thirty years without creating an over-arching theory of democratization. Rather, they want to emphasize certain "themes" of transitions, in particular the nature of uncertainty. They propose that during transitions actors are unaware of their interests or what possible outcomes might result from their interests. They use the analogy of a multidimensional game of chess, in which neither the winner nor the loser can see the outcome even given all available information. \newline
Nonetheless, they do seem to offer an implicit theory of how democratic transitions can happen and which factors can yield effective transitions. First, they theorize about the existence of "pacts", or agreements between opposition and elites in which important political interests are safeguarded. These pacts can help democratic transitions by allaying the fears of elites who might try to form a coup. This is particularly important for safeguarding the interests of the military, which was a prime agent in many of the transitions they studied. \newline
For this reason, they believe that democratization is more likely to occur when the transition process is accomplished through "incrementally and consensually produced change" as opposed to a violent revolution (14). They propose a model in which regime softliners, who can foresee a future for the regime under a transition to democracy, propose initial steps towards liberalization. This consequently leads to an explosion in civil society, at which point the opposition gains strength and demands more concessions. Over time, this process will lead to a full democracy. Nonetheless, they lay out this roadmap in very tentative steps. Many actors can derail the process, such as the military, which must be convinced to return to and stay in its barracks. They think that such a military will only come about through decades of learning and identity change. \newline
\textbf{Critical Evaluation} \newline
The authors have a preference for consensual, moderate change, but it is not always clear why this outcome is preferable to a revolution. They fully acknowledge that pacts may set back a political democracy from achieving its goals, which seems like a serious detriment to their advocacy of incremental change. That is not to say that incremental change may not be the best form of democratization, but rather that the process itself needs to be further identified. The reliance on a certain number of cases from a limited time and geographical period suggests that some of their narrative may be biased towards the experience of Latin American countries. The peculiar role they ascribe to the military may be one area which case studies of other regions may modify. \newline
The gradual transition from an authoritarian regime to a democracy appears to be more the exception than the norm. What appears to be more likely the case is multiple episodes of democratization which transition back and forth from dictatorship to democracy, instead of a gradual, linear path. Thus, their use of Rustow suggests a rather peaceful path to democracy that can avoid the violence often found in regime transitions. This may be a desirable path to transition but one that is nearly impossible to attain for many countries. Rather, it may be more the case that the pendulum swings back and forth, quickly and dangerously, until finally settling into a new equilibrium of either dictatorship or democracy. \newline
However, this book does an admirable job identifying the types and numbers of actors in the transition process, as well as ascribing potential roles and preferences to them. While the book eschews theory, it could be used as a launching pad for more systematic analysis of democratic transitions that seeks to determine what the preferences of key actors are at different points in transitions, as well as to pay attention to the relative time period of transitions. It is a work which generates interesting hypotheses even if it does not provide a coherent theory or empirical support on its own. \newline},

  Annotation               = {\newline Olken does an incredibly impressive randomized study of corruption in road-building in Indonesia. He managed to get the Indonesian government to agree to allow auditing to be assigned to a treatment or control group of villages receiving block grants. He then independently verified the quality of the road with an engineering team. The measurements of the engineering team allowed him to calculate the percentage lost of money spent between the actual and reported expenditures, thus estimating net corruption. He found that audits had a greater effect than the other treatment, grassroots participation, although when he finessed the second treatment he was able to make grassroots participation matter for at least some kinds of road expenditures. Overall a great study, only concern would be the violation of SUTVA with audits: i.e., did other villages learn about the audits and also do corruption less? If so this would only weaken his effect, thus making his study stronger. \newline \newline What is the impact of the study? Is formal accountability always better than community development? Note that the study has never been replicated. Also, the treatment is auditing of probability one versus community monitoring that is much weaker (invitations to attend meeting). \newline},

  Abstract                 = {Recent research on collective action has focused on the occurrence, timing, and sequencing of such events as regime changes, riots, revolutions, protests, and the founding of social movement organizations. Event analysis allows information on the duration, number of participants, presence of violence, or outcome of some particular type of collective action to be compared across social systems or across time periods. This review considers issues of definition, measurement, and methods of estimation in event analysis. It also compares two general varieties of event analysis: approaches that model the dynamics of collective action as a process, and those that do not. A process-oriented approach evaluates how time and covariates (including past events) affect the timing and sequence of repeatable events, and it attempts to explain how events unfold over time. The nonprocess approaches summarize static relationships between levels or characteristics of units and some type of event count.},

The DV is the difference in avg. level of econ growth before transition and after transition. There are two groups: those countries that made 1 transition, and those countries that made no countries. Propensity scores are estimated based on these two groups. Choose the best match, calculate pre and post-transition growth difference, do the same thing for the matched control unit (intervals defined by treatment case). Note that variance in outcome could differ over time, which the method won't capture easily. For example, waves of democratization could affect the economic impacts of what other countries do. \newline \newline Note that they exclude countries that make many short transitions because not enough time has elapsed to estimate the growth effects. Transitions create uncertainty about what the future will be. Stable systems in general may have better growth dynamics. Frequency is removed from this framework.

  Annotation               = {\newline Posner exploits a natural experiment in Africa between Malawi and Zambia concerning four villages located just across the border from each other. The villages are similar in socioeconomic makeup and ethnically homogenous. He argues that he was able to hold enough factors constant in order to examine the effect of the border change as such. His conclusion is that the reason ethnicity is more salient in Malawi is because the relevant ethnic groups are much larger, and hence potentially politically influential, in Malawi than in Zambia. He bases this conclusion on a survey administered to the villages in which respondents report how they view the other ethnic group and whether they would vote for or marry them. It is a compelling analysis asserting the predominant role of 1) elites taking advantage of latent ethnic categories for mobilization and 2) "cultural demography" as a limiting factor in the success of various latent groups. It is also a fascinating qualitative and quantitative exploration of the idea of a natural experiment. \newline \newline Class Discussion: he wants to argue that relative group size is as-if exogenous. Is there any kind of sorting self-selection bias going on? If people sort according to their taste for ethnicity. There are other rules which impact incentives to use ethnicity, including patronage and legislative rules. Where are these villages relative to their constituency and likelihood to receive ethnic favors? Does he over-use the term ``natural experiment"? This term has no formal definition to it. A true natural experiment is a classic instrumental variable. We have to believe that the British did not impose these boundaries due to ethnic concerns and that there wasn't much population transfer afterwards. \newline \newline Note as well that this is a snapshot in time when the argument is based on change over time. No underlying theory of representation and how ethnicity plays into the political game and what are the incentives facing the actors. \newline},

The approach is illustrated through the example of the spread of democratic revolution in the post-communist region during the 2000–2006 period, with significant comparisons to the diffusion of separatist nationalism in the Soviet Union during the glasnost&apos; era.Mark R.

However, he points out that rarely is this true in practice, and that there is much merit to most different systems. If relationships between variables are invariant across different cases, then it can be assumed that the relationship is not due to "inter-systemic factors".

  Annotation               = {\newline Przeworski sets forth a game-theoretic argument based on O'Donnel and Schmitter's division of elites into Hardliners and Reformers. In particular, he analyzes the strategies of a divided opposition (Moderates and Radicals) with these two elite groups in an extensive-form prisoner's dilemma. Moderates and Reformers are the key actors because they are the ones able to bring over their partners into some kind of new regime. However, the most likely outcome is either the status quo dictatorship or an even more strict dictatorship because the Reformers are usually better off allying with the Hardliners because of the threat of the Radicals and Moderates creating a democracy without guarantees. Przeworski uses some references to case studies to back up his assertions, but they primarily by way of illustration. He points to some of the central problems of getting forces to agree on a transition that includes the armed forces, which he believes are critical actor in any transition (and are represented by the Hardliners). His game-theoretic treatment is elementary and primarily involves extensive-form games of complete information, with some reference to imperfect information without capturing it explicitly in the model. \newline},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT Why is there so much alleged electoral fraud in new democracies? Most scholarship focuses on the proximate cause of electoral competition. This article proposes a different answer by constructing and analyzing an original data set drawn from the German parliament's own voluminous record of election disputes for every parliamentary election in the life of Imperial Germany (1871–1912) after its adoption of universal male suffrage in 1871. The article analyzes the election of over 5,000 parliamentary seats to identify where and why elections were disputed as a result of “election misconduct.” The empirical analysis demonstrates that electoral fraud's incidence is significantly related to a society's level of inequality in landholding, a major source of wealth, power, and prestige in this period. After weighing the importance of two different causal mechanisms, the article concludes that socioeconomic inequality, by making elections endogenous to preexisting social power, can be a major and underappreciated barrier to the long-term process of democratization even after the “choice” of formally democratic rules. },
  Annotation               = {\newline Ziblatt does an ingenuous intra-district study of 19th century Germany to test his thesis that landholding inequality blocked the institutionalization of democracy. While he relies on Boix, Robinson and Acemoglu to support his research question, he departs from Boix's insistence (and Przeworksi and Limongi) from differentiating between transitions to democracy and democratic consolidation. Instead, he argues for a gradualist perspective on democracy, in which power imbalances can invalidate democratic institutions even if these institutions have some power. \newline They use data from a German census of farms to construct a Gini coefficient for 19th century Germany. They also have reports from a marvelously efficient complaint resolution body that investigated complaints about electoral fraud. Combining these data, they show that districts in which electoral complaints were the highest were also the ones with the highest level of landholding inequality. \newline Their study shows the power of within-case variation. First, they are able to exploit much more detailed data than relying on national averages. Second, their analysis is able to hold the effects of German institutions and elections constant by virtue of using the same country. It seems that within-case variation could well be the wave of the future. \newline My only question about this piece is his argument for reconceptualizing democracy as both transition and consolidation. I understand the de jure/de facto power difference, but I still think that democratic transitions do exist and do matter. Even if democracy doesn't work as well as it should (on paper).},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT What is the political legacy of violent conflict? I present evidence for a link from past violence to increased political engagement among excombatants. The evidence comes from northern Uganda, where rebel recruitment generated quasiexperimental variation in who was conscripted by abduction. Survey data suggest that abduction leads to substantial increases in voting and community leadership, largely due to elevated levels of violence witnessed. Meanwhile, abduction and violence do not appear to affect nonpolitical participation. These patterns are not easily explained by conventional theories of participation, including mobilization by elites, differential costs, and altruistic preferences. Qualitative interviews suggest that violence may lead to personal growth and political activation, a possibility supported by psychological research on the positive effects of traumatic events. Although the generalizability of these results requires more evidence to judge, the findings challenge our understanding of political behavior and point to important new avenues of research.},

It argues that CPs were a crucial catalyst initiating the development and spread of religious liberty, mass education, mass printing, newspapers, voluntary organizations, and colonial reforms, thereby creating the conditions that made stable democracy more likely. Statistically, the historic prevalence of Protestant missionaries explains about half the variation in democracy in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Oceania and removes the impact of most variables that dominate current statistical research about democracy. The association between Protestant missions and democracy is consistent in different continents and subsamples, and it is robust to more than 50 controls and to instrumental variable analyses. },

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT This article documents that precolonial state development was an impediment to the development of democracy outside Europe, because indigenous state institutions constrained the European colonial endeavor and limited the diffusion of European institutions and ideas. Some countries were strong enough to resist colonization; others had enough state infrastructure that the colonizers would rule through existing institutions. Neither group therefore experienced institutional transplantation or European settlement. Less developed states, in contrast, were easier to colonize and were often colonized with institutional transplantation and an influx of settlers carrying ideals of parliamentarism. Using OLS and IV estimation, I present statistical evidence of an autocratic legacy of early statehood and document the proposed causal channel for a large sample of non-European countries. The conclusion is robust to different samples, different democracy indices, an array of exogenous controls, and several alternative theories of the causes and correlates of democracy.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT Research on violent mobilization broadly emphasizes who joins rebellions and why, but neglects to explain the timing or nature of participation. Support and logistical apparatuses play critical roles in sustaining armed conflict, but scholars have not explained role differentiation within militant organizations or accounted for the structures, processes, and practices that produce discrete categories of fighters, soldiers, and staff. Extant theories consequently conflate mobilization and participation in rebel organizations with frontline combat. This article argues that, to understand wartime mobilization and organizational resilience, scholars must situate militants in their organizational and social context. By tracing the emergence and evolution of female-dominated clandestine supply, financial, and information networks in 1980s Lebanon, it demonstrates that mobilization pathways and organizational subdivisions emerge from the systematic overlap between formal militant hierarchies and quotidian social networks. In doing so, this article elucidates the nuanced relationship between social structure, militant organizations, and sustained rebellion. },

As the analysis shows, most revolutionaries were weakly committed to the revolution's democratic master narrative, and the revolution's spectacular mobilizational success was largely due to its mobilization of cultural cleavages and symbolic capital to construct a negative coalition across diverse policy groupings. A contrast is drawn between urban civic revolutions like the Orange Revolution and protracted peasant revolutions. The strategies associated with these revolutionary models affect the roles of revolutionary organization and selective incentives and the character of revolutionary coalitions. As the comparison suggests, postrevolutionary instability may be built into urban civic revolutions due to their reliance on a rapidly convened negative coalition of hundreds of thousands, distinguished by fractured elites, lack of consensus over fundamental policy issues, and weak commitment to democratic ends. },

While a number of European states increased centralized tax revenues during this period, for others revenues stagnated or even declined and these variations have motivated alternative arguments for the determinants of fiscal and state capacity. This study reviews the arguments concerning the three determinants that have received most attention, namely warfare, economic structure, and political regime, and tests them by making use of a new and comprehensive tax revenue dataset. Our main finding is that these three determinants worked in interaction with each other. Specifically, when under pressure of war, it was representative regimes in more urbanized-commercial economies and authoritarian regimes in more rural-agrarian economies that tended to better aggregate domestic interests towards state-building. },

This article develops a network explanation for how states achieve cooperation in the face of persistent coordination and collaboration problems. The analysis focuses on bilateral cooperation agreements, a vast body of treaties spanning multiple issue areas. Bilateral agreements constitute an evolving network of cooperative ties. This network defines the strategic environment in which states bargain over new agreements, endogenously influencing subsequent bilateral endeavors by revealing strategically valuable information about states’ trustworthiness and preferences over institutional design, while also generating externalities that incentivize bilateral partnerships. Inferential network analysis shows that states are more likely to create bilateral agreements if they (1) share agreements with common third parties, (2) accede to more agreements in general, and/or (3) share important exogenous characteristics with current bilateral partners. These network dynamics drive bilateral cooperation in everything from commodities to cultural exchange to fisheries. },

By explicitly modeling this interaction, I show that social network structure conditions media's impact. Empirical studies of media effects that fail to consider this risk bias. Further, social network interactions can amplify media bias, leading to large swings in aggregate behavior made more severe when individuals can select into media matching their preferences. Countervailing media outlets and social elites with unified preferences can mitigate the effect of bias; however, media outlets promulgating antistatus quo bias have an advantage. Theoretical results such as these generate numerous testable hypotheses; I provide guidelines for deriving and testing hypotheses from the model and discuss several such hypotheses. },

The framework is rich enough to investigate the importance of individual variables, social/peer effects, endogenous trust, political-institutional, and inequality factors as sources of participation. We show that the aforementioned contextual factors explain SC formation for Chile, but their relative importance varies for each kind of participation. Our second application compares individual-level determinants of SC formation among the largest democracies in the Americas. Gender, age, education, and race show heterogeneous effects across countries. Overall, negative interpersonal trust shocks generate participation increments, and possibly motivate engagement in trustworthy networks. Idiosyncratic factors behind participation and trust are positively correlated, suggesting a common SC stem that manifests in multiple ways. Hence, our empirical approach to SC formation uncovers factors hidden by assumptions in some previous literature. },

  Annotation               = {\newline Olsson-Yaouzis uses an evolutionary, transition-matrix approach to overcome the intedeterminancy of rational choice models like Lohmann and Kuran. He argues that an evolutionary model in which people imitate "successful" rebels will produce "stable rest points" that converge either to all revolutionaries or no revolutionaries. Given that there is a threshold beyond which participation will bring down the regime, this model purports to show how game theory can easily derive theories that reveal when revolutions will and will not happen. \newline The actual basis of the evolutionary game is problematic. Do people really have multiple revolutions over which to modify and adjust their behavior? Is it sensible to argue they will be randomly matched with one other person in each round? Does natural selection apply to short-lived, empirically uncertain events? More research will need to be done on this model to determine. What is good about it is that it tries to incorporate at least some element of learning and dynamism into what were previously one-shot models. Note that this model is strongly influenced by Lohmann's although it does not have as much nuance as Lohmann's does. In particular, there are no ideological divisions among the protesters.},

  Abstract                 = {I investigate how and why the Shah's policies of accommodation and repression escalated the revolutionary mobilization of the Iranian population. Several major theories--micromobilization theory, value expectancy, and bandwagon (critical mass) models--are used to sort out the empirical relationships between protest behavior (violent and nonviolent), strikes, spatial diffusion, concessions, and repression in the year prior to the Shah's exit from Iran. Estimates from Poisson regression models show that repression had a short-term negative effect and a long-term positive effect on overall levels of protest via repression's influence on spatial diffusion. I infer that this pattern of effects stems from a combination of deterrent and micromobilization mechanisms. Concessions expanded the protests by accelerating massive urban strikes that in turn generated more opposition activity throughout Iran. Spatial diffusion was encouraged by government concessions and massive labor strikes. Mutually reinforcing relationships between concessions, strikes, and spatial diffusion indicate the significance of intergroup dynamics in the revolutionary process.},

  Annotation               = {He notes the increasing interest among the discipline of having a more focused "identification" strategy for causation. The old days of simply noting potentially rival explanations of correlations are gone. \newline He wonders if this new use of IVs and matching is actually more helpful than not, and looks at welfare systems as an example. He notes that there are three ways electoral institutions could impact welfare systems: 1) structuring politicians benefit strategies, 2) encouraging formation of right over left parties (or vice versa), and 3) changing the position of the median voter. \newline He notes a similar problem to Przeworski: you can only correct for confounders when you have enough variation to match on. In the case of colonial experience, for example, there is nearly a one-to-one match between colonizers and electoral rules, so there is no way to exploit variation to attempt to control for this confounder (17). \newline He notes it is quite difficult to find a good instrument for any kind of variable because of the difficulty of proving that it is truly exogenous to the error term (or "orthogonal"), even if it is correlated with the independent variable. Very critical of Persson and Tabelini. The only way to find good instruments, he argues, is to become a good "analytical historian" (22). \newline He thinks that these ideas need to be worked against strong historical analysis that avoids the use of anecdotes. The current theories are "rational-structuralist", while more "rational-individualist" arguments need to be made to understand the actual calculations made. He also is critical of game theory models assuming perfect information: how could actors know the outcomes under different kinds of institutions? If so, then endogeneity of instutions to rational actors is a non-starter ( 34-35). \newline He concludes with an exhortation to explore field and natural experiments, but to still ground research in good history and going after relevant questions related to causality, even if the answers may not always be available. \newline},

It is a crude test using Polity as a continuous DV and IV lags with year fixed effects. The sample only starts in 1970, which may explain why he later argues H\&M's study is invalid because their dataset goes back so far in history. He also argues for three potential mechanisms: 1) the state replacing and de-politicizing civil society (tested via size of government in terms of GDP), 2) repression effect -- military spending as a proxy for repressio, and 3) modernization effect, which he tests with standard measures of occupational specialization and use of media. He does not try to adjudicate between mechanisms, just uses them as intervening variables in the regression. \newline
\newline Note that model includes a lag, so that it is about changes, not levels. It seems that his argument is about increasing oil revenues making you less democratic. Ross is saying that oil exporters start off more democratic and become less so... but note his dataset starts in 1970 and so is he is making more of a cross-sectional argument. Many of these countries were authoritarian when they discovered oil. \newline},

For that reason, this review focuses primarily on experiments, with some divergence to observational studies as well. The analysis is broadly similar to Holland. What he does go into much further detail are different ways to model the "missing data" on the outcome variable Y: absent randomization, you can try to model the missing data using Bayesian inference. He also mentions how MCMC methods can be used to do this, although he cautions on the danger of choosing a prior over the missing data. He notes that the use of balancing on covariates can decrease variance in estimates even in experimental settings over the basic average causal effect. \newline \newline He also goes in to the problem of non-compliance. He notes that most researchers are trying to estimate CACE, which is the average causal effect for those who comply. Of course the decision to comply also needs to be modeled if it occurred after randomization. You can use missing data models to try to estimate the level of noncompliance. He as well goes in to propensity scores as a way of controlling for confounding variables as opposed to the standard controls in a regression. \newline},

  Annotation               = {\textbf{Hypothesis} \newline. Historical episodes of democratization in Europe and Latin America were caused by alliances between working classes and middle or upper classes, depending on the nature of economic change and institutional development. \newline \textbf{Measurement} \newline They generally differentiate the class structure into upper, middle and lower classes. Upper classes are generally defined by their control of assets in the economy particularly land and capital. Middle classes are the participants in industrialization (i.e., the bourgeoise) or landholders of smaller farms. Lower classes include peasants who stand in a dependent relationship to landlors, and workers, who appear once industrialization sets in. \newline While they admit that class identity is socially constructed, they also argue for a relatively objective imputation of preferences to each of these classes, which allows them to make arguments regarding when institutional or ideological factors prevented classes from realizing their objective interests. \newline \textbf{Research Design} \newline Rueschemeyer, Stephens and Stephens design their study around experiences of democratic transition, consolidation and reversion in Europe and Latin America since 1800. The do not quantify democratic transitions, but rather use a case study-oriented approach that looks at historical causation as a determinant of regime outcomes. They base their study around Marxist perspectives concerning class alliances and regime transition. In particular, they look to the position of actors in socioeconomic structures as the key determinant of outcomes. \newline To that end, they do broadly study economic data and economic change, although again not in a formal sense. Much of their research is drawn from secondary sources (histories) that cover particular time periods in detail. They unify the study through studying the same social classes in different countries across time and space. In that sense, their work could be considered a form of most-different systems design. \newline \textbf{Findings} \newline They initially set forth a hypothesis that the working class, not the bourgoise, was a dominant factor in the success of democratization, and this finding was broadly applicable across their cases. In particular, they note that the bourgoise often only supported democratization in a limited sense involving the inclusion of property rights and suffrage with restrictions. In that sense, the bourgeoise's primary aim was to include itself into the elite coalition previously dominated by the nobility. The bourgeoise, they argue, only supported broader suffrage extension when they allied with the working class. \newline However, they do note that a strong working class can also be a detriment to the success of democracy if the elites do not have a corresponding counter-weight in democracy. This can happen when a rising socialist party confronts an elite which does not have a party of its own to represent itself in democracy. Thus, strong parties are an important precedent for a transition to full democracy. \newline They also argue ideological influences mattered for democratization, particularly when upper classes where able to influence the political ideologies of subordinate classes. This happened when landed elites were particularly strong and had penetrated the state apparatus. If they successfully promulgated an authoritarian ideology, this ideology could delay democratization much later than economic conditions would suggest. \newline Finally, civil society was an important factor in democratization, although the effect of civil society depended on whether landed elites were able to co-opt it. Civil society tended to ally with whatever class was able to promulgate a hegemonic ideology, thus in Germany the Nazis came to power in part through civil society. Overall, though, they were optimistic on the role civil society could play at encouraging working class mobilization outside of state structures. \newline \textbf{Critical Evaluation} \newline The authors' great strength is their ability to track the positions of classes across considerable lengths of time and space. This broad variety in scope enables them to abstract away from contextual factors to focus on theoretical development and testing. In particular, their analysis of the objective interests of the classes in question is compelling. To the extent the working class existed as a social entity, it did have a democratic impulse. Their revisionist account of bougeois politics is a helpful re-analysis of the oft-cited argument about the important role of a broad middle class at supporting democratization. \newline What is less helpful about the study is the lack of specificity about how each of the factors worked themselves out across cases. The individual cases were written by different authors, and while they have done an admirable job attempting to condense their work, there are still some places where it seems different theoretical approaches are being used to justify different conclusions. \newline In addition, their strong theoretical assumptions about the role of classes in history sometimes leads to an assumption of a cause because of an existence of an effect. In particular, when they aver that strong states explain variations in their theory it seems that the state is being uses as deux ex machina to explain shortfalls in their theoretical explanation. Similarly, their analysis of ideology is less than satisfactory. If landed elites are able to create ideologies which endure past economic conditions, then it seems that authoritarianism should be unconquerable. Ideology is an unstable factor which does not fit easily into their typology. \newline The book could be strengthened if the theory could be summarized more adequately, and if the narratives of the cases followed a more similar format that identified key episodes and made them more comparable. It is hard to keep the histories straight between cases, and hard to know when important details are being left out without clear definitions for which events in the countries' history are to be included in each case. \newline},

  Abstract                 = {Individuals influence each others' decisions about cultural products such as songs, books, and movies; but to what extent can the perception of success become a “self-fulfilling prophecy”? We have explored this question experimentally by artificially inverting the true popularity of songs in an online “music market,” in which 12,207 participants listened to and downloaded songs by unknown bands. We found that most songs experienced self-ful- filling prophecies, in which perceived—but initially false—popularity became real over time. We also found, however, that the inversion was not self-fulfilling for the market as a whole, in part because the very best songs recovered their popularity in the long run. Moreover, the distortion of market information reduced the correlation between appeal and popularity, and led to fewer overall downloads. These results, although partial and speculative, suggest a new approach to the study of cultural markets, and indicate the potential of web-based experiments to explore the social psychological origin of other macrosocio- logical phenomena.},

  Abstract                 = {\newline Sekhon argues that Geddes' critique of Skocpol is inaccurate if Skocpol is interpreted to be making probabilistic as opposed to deterministic statements about causation. That is to say, foreign intervention may raise the probability of revolution even if it does not always produce revolution. Thus he argues for the use of conditional probabilities as a way of understanding the outcomes of case studies. This is different from Mill's original methods, which assumed a deterministic aspect of causation devoid of measurement error. Conditional probalities are not synonymous with causation (they don't overcome the fundamental problem of causal inference), but they can provide a better framework for the conclusions reached by qualitative studies. It is a fundamentally Bayesian perspective: given our knowledge of the world, event X is more or less likely than expected. \newline},
  Annotation               = {\newline Deterministic statements are just implausible given the complexity of the world. Rather, we should use conditional probabilities as a way of understanding what qualitative inference is all about. Nothing is specific to qualitative research: just admit it is essentially quantitative with fewer observations. He wants to drop both the ``uniqueness" and ``determinism" assumptions of Przerworski and Teune. But if you have only 2 cases, how can you speculate about probabilities and possible outcomes? Note that he doesn't really care about mechanisms; inference can be done with and without mechanisms. As in aspirin--why did the guy win a nobel prize for finding the mechanism? You can figure out causation without mechanisms, but it is very incomplete. \newline \newline Sometimes, mechanisms may have normative implications, so it is still important to understand them. Also, if the outcome of interest isn't the only concern, then black-box causality isn't enough. \newline},

  Review                   = {--Egypt's partial liberalization of politics is really only a facade designed to ensure "regime continuity" and create "a culture of apathy and indifference" (101) --he believes that the goal of liberalization is to create an "acceptable succession" for Gamal, his son, instead of the Syria model (102) --in the 2000 elections, the National Democratic Party (Mubarak) only won 38 percent of the seats, but after the election they "allowed" "NDP independents" to rejoin the party, it went up to 85.8 percent. The NDP has won most elections since 1976 by a landslide (102) --the NDP created an advisory group headed by Gamal in 2002, which Shahin argues led to more demands for reform. The NDP produced a modest document in 2004 that emphasized economic liberalization without much political impact (103) --Gamal was also seen as heading this "reform" movement in the party, which Shahin argues was an attempt to build support for Gamal (104) --Shahin thinks that succession concerns and external (U.S. & E.U.) pressure induced Mubarak to allow an amendment to be approved by referendum allowing for multiple candidates to compete in elections: although they were never meant to be competititve (105) --Mubarak won overwhelmingly in 2005, but with turnout of only 23 percent (105-106) --"reform movements", including Kifaya, started in 2004 and 2005, which Shahin believes is because of the lack of effective opposition parties (106-107) --Kifaya managed to gain up to 20,000 supporters by 2008 (where did this estimate come from?), and is noted for its clear opposition to a continuation of Mubarak's rule (father or son). however, it has been hobbled by leadership splits and Shahin believes it cannot coalesce into a politicaly party bc it lacks a coherent ideology (107-108) --"The National Rally for Democratic Transition" is an elite-led group that espoused less controversial statements than kifaya (108) --the secular/liberal parties are riven by ideological and leadership splits, and privately they express support for the authoritarian regime because the alternative (the MB) is considered to be worse (109-10) -- the "Judges Club" is a group of judges who initiated a reform movement in 2004 to gain more independence for the judiciary, but regime repression had managed to quelch it by 2006 (110-111) -- the MB has followed a more complicated strategy. Partly in response to kifaya, and partly in response to perceived regime weakness, they launched their own "symbolic" protests and put forward a reform agenda that was short on religion and high on policy. however, they do not seem to want to overthrow the regime, and this could be a part of regime-MB calculations (112-13) --in parliamentary elections in 2005, the MB won about 20 percent of seats, but the secular-liberal parties took very few (114) the strong showing of the MB led to a later regime crackdown and a postponing of local elections. journalists, judges, and civil society have all faced a more difficult environment in ensuing years (115-117) --Shahin thinks that Egypt needs "new social actors" who can create a much stronger opposition. He thinks that Kifaya etc. are too "elitist", although he doesn't want to discount them entirely (118) --Shahin notes that current institutions are too restrictive to allow real competition, but he advocates gradual institutional change as a realistic strategy for the opposition, not revolution (118-19)},

Social revolutions are set apart from other sorts of conflict and transformative processes above all by the combination of two coincidences: the coincidence of societal structural change with class upheaval; and the coincidence of political with social transformation." Thus, you have to change both society and the state (4) versus rebellion: "In contrast, rebellions, even when successful, may involve the revolt of subordinate classes--but they do not eventuate in structural change" (4) versus political revolution: "Political revolutions transform state structures but not social structures, and they are not necessarily accomplished through class conflict" (4) you have to have both political and social macrostructural change (5) also, change must be successful. she thinks that successful revolutions are different than unsuccessful ones (5) she defines Ted Gurr Why Men Rebel as a psychological argument regarding anger --> collective action, based on relative deprivation -- similar to Pearlman (9) she uses Marxism and political opportunity theories (13) overall, her approach is structuralist in a true sense. she does not think that revolution was "voluntarist", and she wants to pay attention to international dimensions of regimes (14)},

  Annotation               = {\newline In this article, the authors take on the A\&R perspective on redistribution and democracy in a straightforward manner. They argue that it is state capacity which is the critical precedent to democratization, not redistribution. This is true because the Melter and Richards model assumes that voters will receive the taxes they vote for; however, in many "postcolonial" states there is limited administrative capacity and taxes are difficult to collect. Thus the A\&R model breaks down because it assumes away the central problem of moving towards a consolidated democracy. \newline In addition, they argue against the class-centered approach to democratization by repeating Skocpol's insight concerning the autonomy of the state. They think the military is not a natural ally of the rich and that assuming the wealthy can cause a coup to happen is a foolish assumption to make. They use a stastical model of regime transitions and direct taxes to argue that taxes do not increase post-transition. They also do some small-n work of East Asia to look at actual regimes (such as Suharto's Indonesia) in which taxation increased post-transition. \newline Of course, this paper opens the black box of identifying why certain states are able to tax and build capacity, whereas others are not. They point to some of the elite bargain models in which dictators assume power with wealthy support and in turn will receive more taxes. While they cite Evans and embedded autonomy, they then relive that debate concerning what it is that can make a state operate such a unique position in society. \newline \newline Is state capacity a variable which can be properly understood as something inhibiting democratization? Or is it a secondary story which is only tangentially related to democratization? There are strong states and weak states and democracy may be on of either without breaking down. It is almost a truism to say that a strong state will avoid breakdown because that is part of what a strong state is defined to be (i.e., it resists changes of its type). There needs to be a non-tautological way of defining state capacity to make the argument work. However, the point is well-taken that taxation under democratic regimes may be regressive because it is never collected and instead states rely on indirect taxes. What would be interesting to know is whether taxation is the appropriate indicator for state capacity. What is the most important part of state capacity? Could it be the military? Is there some connection between having a strong revenue system and controlling militaries? Or would managing revenue better only invite military intervention? Also, there recommendation to ``pay militaries well" also doesn't fit with the observable record. But their point on state autonomy is well-taken. \newline
\newline class discussion: how can they possibly have a positive coefficient on oil revenues influencing taxation post-coup (in their OLS model)? That doesn't seem to make much sense. Their data does show though that taxation does decrease the incidence of coups. Are taxes the best indicator of state strength? Also, taxes are not a great way to test for income inequality, which may involve redistribution of very different kinds (land reform). \newline},

  Annotation               = {\newline Stacher argues that Egypt was less centralized in terms of its governing institutions than Syria, enabling elites during Egypt's transition to smoothly re-integrate themselves into the post-Mubarak era. The connecting tissue between centralization and ``autocratic adaptability" is difficult to understand. Essentially he thinks that the military was able to assume Mubarak's post during the transition, later enabling them to steer entire ship with ease (85). Centralization began under Sadat, who gutted Egypt's military autonomy and continued and was emphasized under Mubarak. \newline},

  Review                   = {Tarrow is interested in the definition of collective action as a response to a changing political institutional incentive structure. He has a creative typology of collective action, which focuses on 1) collective action as conflict (Marx), collective action as the work of a revolutionary vanguard/resource mobilization (Lenin), and collective action as "cultural hegemony" (Gramsci/collective frames/identity (p. 10-18) culture and framing cannot explain why some narratives form while others do not p. 17-18 --he likes Tilly's idea of "political opportunity structure" (p. 18-19) --whether or not movements coalesce in a given political opportunity depends on their ability to mobilize (resource mobilization) (p. 20) --people use forms of protest that were used previously in history--adaptive learning (p. 21) he thinks that Olson's concern about group size is mitigated by networks: large groups are formed of many small networks (p. 23) "cycles of contention" occur when one successful social movement causes other social movements to form to challenge its success (p. 24-25). these can morph into revolutions if they challenge the "sovereignty" of the state to get strong movements, "institutional access" must change (p. 71) social movements form essentially when politicians are amenable to the changes (p. 73) thus, he uses the example of glasnost in the former USSR as a paradigmatic example of how changes in political opportunities yield social movements (p. 74-75) --resource mobilization is about resources internal to the group, whereas political opportunities are external to the group (p. 77) it is the relative level of political opportunity that matters: whether or not people had such opportunities before (i.e., democratic societies do not see constant contention) (p. 78-79)},

  Annotation               = {\newline Tilly sets out his own version of democratization (and de-democratization) theory. He focuses on four factors of democracy, drawing heavily from Dahl (1998) and Levi (1997). These are: breadth, equality, protection, and "mutually binding consultation". Each of these factors are to some extent independent of each other and can be analyzed separately. He futher looks at three main variables that affect whether democratization is achieved: integration of trust networks into public politics, reduction of "categorical inequalities" in the public sphere, and submission of "autonomous power centers" to the state. \newline He also operationalizes a two-dimensional index that measures state capacity against the four features of democracy that he offers. He thinks that paths to democracy depend heavily on the relative level of state capacity. He ends up arguing, a bit like A\&R, that there is a golden mean level of state capacity at which democratization is the most likely. This is not at exactly medium capacity, but at high but not extremely high capacity. Extremely high capacity he identifies with states relying on natural resources, which he argues violates mutually binding consultation because then elites don't tax their citizens. \newline He uses a variety of case studies to support his point without being overly systematic. This is a theoretical work used to build a process-tracing model of democracy. He is critical of Boix and Przeworski models of minimal, procedural democracy, arguing for much more analytical nuance. \newline I found his emphasis on the integration of trust networks very interesting and a potential re-analysis of Putnam that can put trust on a firmer theoretical footing. He notes that the incorporation of these trust networks into the government is a key condition for state capacity, and hence democratization. Democratization can't exist without state capacity because then people won't be willing to operate under "contingent consent" (Levi). They need to know that the parchment institutions of the state will be enforced in the future. \newline It is possible to transition to democracy as a weak state, but Tilly thinks this requires a foreign patron. His analysis does not use much incorporation of foreign influence on regime formation absent the role of "foreign shocks". Similarly, he largely avoids ideological analysis, or even the kind of "political learning" that Bermeo offers. Political actors need to figure out how to attain these conditions, but why they would want to is often left unexplored. It is an assumed historical process with certain preconditions. But it does not answer the question why citizens should move towards this kind of regime as opposed to another.},

  Year                     = {1999},

  Annotation               = {\newline Waldner offers a profound explanation of Turkey, Syria, Taiwan and Korea's development paths that is rich in historical detail but also provocative in its methodological argument and conclusions. Waldner comes down on the side of new endogenous growth theory and strategic trade theory in reintepreting the history of ISI v. ELG (export-led growth), but he does so from a consistently historical institutionalist perspective. From that end, he eschews formal models, although he relies on much rational choice scholarship, particularly Bates' use of rents as a means of sustaining political coalitions. \newline \newline Waldner's basic argument is that elite cohesion determines the structural possibilities of a choice of development path. His treatment of ideologies is less well-developed, but he essentially thinks that most elites have similar preferences but face different structural constraints on their actions. Syria and Turkey's elites had much higher levels of internal conflict, thus they were more prone to include the "popular classes" in coalitional bargains. This increased the demands for state rents which went against market logic and doomed them to poor development outcomes regardless of the choice of development ideology. In contrast, Taiwan and Korea had relatively unified elites (due to historical legacies of war and socioeconomic changes), so they could exclude the popular classes during their industrialization phase and harness the power of the state to overcome "Gerschenkronian" (capital) and "Kaldorian" (productivity) coordination issues. \newline \newline By so doing, Waldner relies heavily on Evans to argue that the embeddedness and autonomy of states is critical in the ability of states to undertake development. In particular, he argues that Syrian and Turkish elites included elites with independent bases of social and economic control (i.e., landlords), so that when industrialization happened, some elites faced possible loss of their position through the industrialization process. In order to overcome elite resistance, modernizing elites had to make an alliance with the working classes, even if the working classes had no preceding political movement. Thus he offers a very elite-centered model for explaining the rise and failure of development trajectories. \newline \newline Waldner concludes with a methodological argument against deductive hypothesis testing a la Mills method of agreement. He argues instead for a broader view of causal mechanisms as causal logics, and that an explanation fails if its causal logic could not have explained the outcome even if the variables of interest are present in the cases to be studied. Thus, the explanation needs to have appropriate causal linkages between the variables and the outcome, it cannot simply assert the linkages when the variables are present. On the other hand, if an argument asserts that a certain kind of variable always causes an outcome, the argument can be discarded if those variables are present and the outcome isn't. This may be a deficiency in the argument, not the evidence, but it is a logically consistent step. \newline \newline My own analysis is that Waldner does not account for the relative importance of different types of collective action dilemmas. Do problems of coordination outweigh the risks of state intervention? Also, why is the state able to foresee economic problems more effectively than economic actors? An assumption is that both the state and firms share the same identification of economic problems, but that the state has superior ability to overcome coordination problems. Given how tricky economic issues are, this seems like economic analysis in hindsight. The use of two or three cases to establish the effectiveness of intervention seems too limited. Waldner has a great argument about state institutions and economic development, but I think it needs to be broadened beyond intervention to overcome collective actions problems. Rather, it seems that state intervention to enforce norms of justice is equally as important, if not more so. \newline},

In particular, they think that state institutions are exogenous to rents: based on case study research, it appears that most countries were weak states prior to the discovery of oil, and that when strong states discover oil it does not have deleterious effects. Part of the problem is defining the counterfactual: if states did not have oil, would they be poor dictatorships or wealthy democracies? Rentier thesis seems to imply they would be wealthy democracies, but it is hard to know that using any kind of statistical test (or comparative study). \newline},

  Annotation               = {\newline Wantchekon did an amazing study where he worked out a deal with Benin political parties to allow him to tell them where to run their political platforms. He randomized on a per-village basis, some of which were in competitive districts and some of which were in non-competitive districts. While the competitive districts suffered from outside manipulation, the results from the non-comp districts are pretty clear. Public good platforms tend to do worse than clientelistic platforms, although not so among women, who value public goods more (as reflected in voting records). While there was some concern about SUTVA, and the fact that the experiment is almost unrepeatable, it is an admirable study in determining the presence of clientelism v. public goods as electoral persuasion. \newline \newline Class discussion: How do you evaluate external validity from Benin? Why do women care less about particularist goods? Is it about occupational choice? If women are traveling beween regions, does that threaten the research design? Then the villages are no longer independent of each other. Do people in Benin talk a lot about campaigns? Is the estimated quantity (noncompetitive districts) interesting? How do we make the information conveyed credible? How can a public goods appeal be credible? The different parties did not have specific scripts. \newline},

  Abstract                 = {How does the resource base of a rebel group impact its membership, structure, and behavior? While scholars, analysts, and policy makers increasingly link natural resources to the onset and duration of civil war, this article explores how resource endowments shape the character and conduct of rebel groups. This article identifies a rebel “resource curse” much like the one that undermines state institutions in resource-rich environments. While the presence of economic endowments makes it possible for leaders to recruit on the basis of short-term rewards, these groups are flooded with opportunistic joiners who exhibit little commitment to the long-term goals of the organization. In resource-poor environments, leaders attract new recruits by drawing on social ties to make credible promises about the private rewards that will come with victory. Opportunistic joiners stay away from these movements, leaving a pool of activist recruits willing to invest their time and energy in the hope of reaping large gains in the future.},

  Abstract                 = {This article goes beyond the established literature’s focus on domestic conditions by examining the impact of external impulses on European democratization from 1830 to 1940. Specifically, it analyzes the diffusion of regime conflict that arose from the cross-national spread of situational judgments about the feasibility of political change: Striking precedents of regime collapse, such as the overthrow of French kings in 1830 and 1848, tended to produce dramatic waves of political contention across Europe. But because the actual distribution of power in polities that experienced such externally stimulated episodes of regime contention often differed from the front-runner, these conflicts produced various types of results. The article distinguishes four outcomes of diffusion, namely (a) successful replication, (b) preemptive reform, (c) abortive replication, and (d) blockage of replication efforts. The latter two outcomes help explain why in European history, not only did political liberalism and democracy diffuse, but during certain time periods authoritarianism, corporatism, and fascism spread as well.},

They have an impressive recruitment effort, involving nearly two hundred people of each of three ethnicities (Croat, Serb, Bosnian) from a random stratified sample (admittely, the sample had some issues, but response rate was very high). They do not use the Ultimatum or any other kind of game. They run two games, one in which people propose to their own ethnics, and a second in which they propose to other ethnicities. They then look at difference in means. They find that there is a difference, although it is marginally negative, and the median is zero (i.e., not a very strong effect, even if it passes statistical significance). In addition, overal levels of "fairness" measured by group offers are not different from other, less war-torn societies. \newline \newline They also estimate a multivariate model where they use ethnic threat perception and ties to see if it explains variance in in group versus out group offers. They find that there is a strong relationship between these variables, which questions their assertion that ethnicity was not a causal driving factor in the war. If strength of ties does in fact lower out group offers, then perhaps what has changed in the intervening years is the strength of these ties, not some overriding norm of fairness per se. \newline},

The article presents two broad theoretical principles. The first is that one cannot understand the role of social media in collective action without first taking into account the political environment in which they operate. The second principle states that a significant increase in the use of the new media is much more likely to follow a significant amount of protest activity than to precede it. The study examines these two principles using political, media, and protest data from twenty Arab countries and the Palestinian Authority. The findings provide strong support for the validity of the claims.},

  Publisher                = {Oxford University Press},
  Year                     = {2003},

  Annotation               = {\newline Woodward offers a compelling alternative to both purely philosophical approaches to causation and also the developing theory of causal inference in statistics. He wants to provide a theory that is accessible to people who are investigating causal claims (both natural and social sciences) as well as ground it in a philosophically rigorious framework. He is not able to achieve both of these goals perfectly, but he does an admirable job bringing the discussion far more forward than it was before his work came out. \newline \newline He is critical of the deductive-nomological model of Hemper because it relies on deductive statements of natural laws which do not offer coherent explanations. For example, you can deduce that someone is a certain race because of a valid major premise, but this does not explain why they are of a certain race. Rather, Woodward wants a manipulationist account of causation: we explain things because we want to know how they would change under a set of background conditions and a variation in the causal variables. \newline \newline This does open up the possibility of how manipulation can be understood about celestial objects and other natural phenomena which could never be manipulated by humans. Woodward tries to draw distinction between counterfactuals of interventions which would be plausible even if not technologically possible and counterfactuals which fundamentally change the object of explanation. Thus if a counterfactual would produce more new variables which would change the outcome (hence, no invariance), then it is a counterfactual which is excludable under consideration (the Julius Caeasar in Korea example). \newline \newline He first establishes philosophical definitions for his version of causality. These are: \newline \newline TC: total cause. Implies where there is any measurable effect of X on Y given an intervention. However, this definition is subject to the weakness that it does not include variables which may be counter-balanced by other variables and thus have no net effect even if they figure in causal explanation. \newline \newline DC: direct cause. A cause is a DC when all variables besides X and Y are held fixed and an intervention on X influences Y. This shows that X is causal to Y even if an uncontrolled intervention produces no effect. The use of control allows for the "true" effect to be established, even if under observational data in nature there is no effect. This is what happens when you have a "countervailing" cause. \newline \newline NC*: NC* relies on DC to show what a necessary condition for a cause is. X does not need to be an immediate ancestor of Y, but only an ancestor of variables Z such that each Z is a DC of Y and X is a DC of Z. This is what is called a "contributing cause": X has an effect on Y mediated through other variables. X is not a DC of Y because holding any of these Zs fixed means that X has no effect on Y given an intervention. \newline \newline M: for a cause to be a DC of Y, there must be an intervention on X that changes Y given fixed values for other variables Z to Y (but excluding X). For X to be a contributing cause, the same logic holds, except that X is now on a path from including intermediary Zs to Y. Thus Woodward says both DC and contributing cause X are contributing causes because it is not sufficient for a TC given an intervention (without holding other values fixed). \newline \newline Is causation transitive? If A causes B and B causes C, is it transitive? Not necessarily because the range of variables may not match up. B can have many causes which do not affect its relationship with C because it doesn't affect the relevant range. \newline \newline Woodward defines intervention as follows. IV: An intervention variable (IV) must influence X but also act as a "switch" preventing other variables from influencing X. The IV must only influence Y through X and not independently, as well have no relationship to any Zs which also influence Y but not through X. An actual intervention, IN, is when the IV assumes a value that changes X's value and thus Y's value. Only the manipulation on X can change Y. I.e., only the "treatment" matters. We can't affect Y on a path not via X, including any direct connection between I and Y. \newline \newline Note that it can also be that there is a Z variable between I and X, as long as all influence only goes through X. Interventions have to be conceptually and logically possible, not human. He says they must be "well-defined": what does that mean? For example: colonialism and economic development. Is there a valid counterfactual for whether Argentina were a Spanish v. English colony? That intervention fails because the unit ceases to exist when the intervention fails. Argentina would be no more. Even the question is not well-defined. Holland uses the same logic to talk about traits of human beings: you can't intervene on someone's race. What we can't impose as a manipulation, can't be a cause. \newline \newline how does replication work? Not just replicating data, but replicating the full experiment to know that the change is invariant. Scope conditions have to be met. \newline \newline What does it mean for a cause to be a "causal possibility"? Sometimes very unlikely causes have a big effect. Re: 9\11 hijackers causing a war in Iraq. \newline \newline Does token causation matter? Can you speak of causation with a single case? \newline},
